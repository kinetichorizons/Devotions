<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Look up...because in times like
these, your very life may depend on it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Some time ago, the Lord showed me
that a spirit of weariness is trying to work its way into our lives these days
through all the pressure and bad news that surrounds us. It's working to get
our eyes off the Word of God by bombarding us with negative forces. It's trying
to get us to look down at defeat instead of up at Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you let that happen, your
spirit man will begin to lose his dominion. And the Word tells us what the
results of that is. It says you will &quot;be wearied and faint in your
minds.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus put it this way in Mark 4.
He said that when the cares of this world enter into your heart and mind,
they'll choke the Word and cause it to become unfruitful. And since your faith
is the product of the Word, that means your faith will wither. Once that
happens, you're headed for disaster.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What can you do to stop this
chain reaction of weariness?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Look up! Get your eyes back on
Jesus. I remember on the field of athletic competition that when an opponent
allowed himself to drop his head, he was no longer dangerous. He could be very
easily defeated. So keep your head up. Keep considering Jesus, the Author and
Finisher of your faith. Consider Him instead of the cares of this world.
Consider what God says in His Word. Be moved by the thoughts of God. Let His
thoughts become your thoughts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Look up! Get your eyes off the
circumstances around you and onto your heavenly source. Don't be afraid you're
going to lose everything. God is your Source, not the world. He can take care
of you regardless of what happens around you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you've gotten weary lately,
begin to lift your eyes. Raise your head up instead of looking down. God is up.
Jesus is up. The devil is down--under your feet. Look up! <b>Scripture Reading:</b>
Isaiah 40:21-31</p>
