<h1>Be a Blessing </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:.25pt;text-align:center'>Let
those who favor my righteous cause and have pleasure in my uprightness shout
for joy and be glad, and say continually, Let the Lord be magnified, Who takes
pleasure in the prosperity of His servant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:1.5pt;text-align:center'>Psalm 35:27</p>

text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If traditional religion has
taught you that God wants you poor and oppressed, I have good news for you
today. The Bible says, &quot;God takes pleasure&quot; in your prosperity. God
wants you to prosper!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Not just in the financial realm
but in every area of your life...spirit, soul, and body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>No matter where you are or who
you are, God wants to see you delivered from every adverse situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Why? Because He loves you and He
has a job for you to do. He wants you to help meet the needs of mankind and
He's smart enough to know that you can't give away what you don't have. You
can't give to spread the gospel or buy food for the hungry when you're broke.
You can't go out laying hands on the sick when you're lying in a hospital bed.
You can't minister joy to others when you're being held captive by depression.
No! You have to be blessed to be a blessing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you really want to tap into
the riches of God today, make up your mind to be a blessing to others, and
before you know it, you'll be receiving more from God than you ever dreamed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's what happened to me. I
decided years ago, first and foremost, to be a giver. I developed a lifestyle
of giving. Today, I literally &quot;live to give.&quot; And I don't mind
telling you, God dumps blessings on me by the truckload!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He'll do the same for you if
you'll become His servant--if you'll lay down your time and your money and your
love for those who need it. Become a giver--and God will take pleasure in
prospering you!</p>
