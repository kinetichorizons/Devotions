<h1>Let the World Know </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.35pt;
margin-bottom:1.0pt;margin-left:3.25pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:99%'>Neither pray I
for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their
word. ...that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me,
that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou
hast sent me. John 17:20,22-23</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Over the years the Church has
come up with all kinds of elaborate ways to evangelize the world. We get
together and map out plans and strategies and raise money for it. But through
it all, we rarely mention the plan that Jesus gave us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Most believers don't even realize
that He gave us the key to winning the world, but He did. He prayed about it
right before He went to the Cross. He asked the Father to bring us into a place
of such oneness with each other and with Him that the world would know that He
had been sent from God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you and I and all the rest of
the Body of Christ would get together and start loving each other, we'd
evangelize the world so fast it would make your head swim. It's true. But until
recently, we've been too busy scrapping with one another and getting our
feelings hurt to give it much thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But, praise God, it's beginning
to dawn on some folks now that we need to stop that stuff. We need to start
treating Jesus' command that we love one another as a command instead of an
alternative. We need to drop our silly arguments and be unified by the Spirit
of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you want to take a step toward
evangelizing the world today? Then start praying for oneness. Make up your mind
that you're going to start loving your fellow believers instead of criticizing,
complaining, and talking ugly about them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Start confessing that the Church
of God is going to rise up together in faith and love as one glorious Body
driven by the power of Jesus Himself. We are, you know. Jesus prayed that it
would happen, and the Holy Spirit is already bringing it to pass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Satan would like to stop it, but
he can't. It's far more powerful than he is--and it's going to blast a hole in
his operation that's big enough to drive a train through. It's going to let the
whole world know that Jesus truly is Lord!</p>
