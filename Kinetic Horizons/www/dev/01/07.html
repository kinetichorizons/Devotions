<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't ever be so afraid of making
a mistake you miss out on the joy of acting on the voice of the Lord. Instead,
trust the leadership of the Holy Spirit and let Him show you how. He'll begin
by speaking to you about the little things in your life, and as you grow
accustomed to hearing and obeying, He'll speak to you about weightier things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's how it happened with
Gloria and me. When we first accepted Jesus as Lord, we didn't have any idea
how to hear God. Our spirits weren't yet trained to distinguish His leading.
But since the Bible promised we could do it, we began to approach our prayer
time and Bible study time expecting to hear God's direction and He began to
give it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I'll never forget the first time
it happened to Gloria. She'd been reading the Bible and she just stopped for a
few minutes to see if God would say something to her. Right down on the inside
of her, she heard the Lord say, &quot;The light is on in your car.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It didn't occur to her that God
would speak to her about something so trivial, so she just brushed that thought
aside and went on listening. Pretty soon, He said the same thing again. He kept
on repeating it until finally, she got up and walked out to the car. Sure
enough, the light was on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Why would God bother with
something as insignificant as a car light? Because He cares! He knew Gloria was
home alone that night with two small children, and if that battery had run
down, she'd have been stuck there. God was watching out for her, and He told
her just exactly what she needed to know right then.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Yet, at the same time, He knew
she was a beginner where listening to His voice was concerned, so He gave her
an instruction she could follow without much risk. I mean, what if she had gone
out there and the light hadn't been on? What if she'd missed it? She would have
felt foolish but that wouldn't have hurt anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you'll trust Him, the Holy
Spirit will do the same thing for you that He did for Gloria and me. He'll
bring you along one step at a time in a way that will help you, not hurt you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The biggest mistake you can make
is to be afraid to follow that inward witness which is the number one way God
leads all His children (Rom. 8:14). So don't be afraid. Take time to listen
today. Expect to hear in your spirit. God has something to say to you. <b>Scripture
Reading:</b> 1 Corinthians 2:6-16</p>
