<h1>No Time for Clay Pots </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.35pt;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:.85pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>But
in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of
wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:.85pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>2
Timothy 2:20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Are you destined for greatness in
the kingdom of God?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Ask most believers that question
and they'll humbly assure you they're not. &quot;You know we can't all be
golden vessels&quot; they'll say. &quot;Like the Bible says, some of us are
just called to be little clay pots.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Praise God, the Bible doesn't say
any such thing!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Certainly there are going to be
some golden vessels in the kingdom and there are going to be some clay pots,
but we are the ones--not God--who determine which kind we will be. Second
Timothy 2:21 tells us that &quot;whoever cleanses himself [from what is ignoble
and unclean]--who separates himself from contact with contaminating and
corrupting influences-- will [then himself] be a vessel set apart and useful
for honorable and noble purposes, consecrated and profitable to the Master, fit
and ready for any good work&quot; (AMP).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Golden vessel or clay pot, the
choice is up to you!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Why then do so many believers
choose to do menial work in the kingdom of God? Why are they content to remain
clay pots?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Because they lack one thing every
golden vessel must have. They lack dedication. They haven't made a quality
decision to separate themselves from contaminating influences. They haven't
been willing to turn away from the ways of the world and go on with God past
the point of no return.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>My friend, God is doing some exciting
things on this earth right now. He's working signs and wonders, paving the way
for Jesus' return. This is a thrilling time, but it's definitely no time for
clay pots! So if you haven't yet made the kind of commitment that will turn you
into a golden vessel, admit it. Then take the time to get before God and study
His Word and get your will in line with His. Let the Holy Spirit deal with you
until you're willing to leave the ways of the world behind and walk in higher
ways--the ways of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do it now. The hour is late. The
glory of God is spilling over the earth in one final thrilling wave. It's not
trickling out of clay pots. It's being poured through golden vessels--and
that's exactly what God is calling you to be.</p>
