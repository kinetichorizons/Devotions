<h1>Don't Look at the Storm </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:4.9pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%'>But when he saw the wind boisterous,
he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.2pt;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:3.7pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus
stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little
faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:3.7pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Matthew 14:30-31</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:6.3pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If there's any way the devil can
get your eyes away from the Word, he'll do it. He'll cause trouble. He'll make
the circumstances around you pitch and roll like a rowboat in a hurricane.
He'll do anything he can to get you to concentrate on the realm of the physical
senses and the situation around you instead of on the promise of God-because he
knows that if he doesn't, you'll take that promise and beat his brains out with
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's what he did to Peter. When
Peter first jumped out of the boat that day in response to Jesus' word, what
happened? He walked right across that water without a problem. His whole being
was fastened on that word Jesus had spoken to him, &quot;Come!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But when he took his eyes off
that word, he started looking at the storm. He started looking at the
impossible thing he was doing. After all, he was a fisherman. All his training
and experience told him when the waves were that high, you were going under. He
started to focus on what he knew in the natural instead of what Jesus said.
When he did that, his faith slipped out of gear and he started to sink.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't let that happen to you.
Once you get a revelation from the Word of God, hang onto it. Don't focus on
anything else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The devil will do everything he
can to get you to turn loose of it. He'll stir up things around you. He'll try
to get you into fear. He'll push every button he can from the past to get you
back into your old way of thinking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But don't let go. Keep your eyes
on the Word of God until it's more real inside you than anything else. If you
do, you'll be able to walk your way across the water just fine.</p>
