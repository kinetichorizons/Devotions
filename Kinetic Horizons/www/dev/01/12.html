<h1>Our Only Hope is Jesus </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.6pt;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:1.1pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Therefore did my heart rejoice, and
my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: Because thou
wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see
corruption.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:1.1pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Acts 2:26-27</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:3.8pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Twenty-one years ago, God said
something to me that will mark my ministry forever. The only hope that any man
has anywhere in the world is faith in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In light of what's happening
around us today, the truth of the statement is more painfully obvious than ever
before. We are a generation with diseases no man can heal, with problems no man
can solve. What fleeting successes we have are quickly overshadowed by new and
greater crises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>All too often, that's as true for
believers as it is for unbelievers. It shouldn't be. But it is. Believers are
being killed by the same diseases that are devastating the rest of the world.
They're being plagued by the same problems. And many are walking around without
hope--just like the rest of the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Why? Because the only hope that
any man has is faith in Jesus Christ. And the majority of Christians don't know
how to live by faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Instead of being filled with the
Word and with faith, they've been stuffed full of religious tradition and
superstition. And they're suffering. When the devil hits them with sickness and
disease, with poverty or depression or divorce, they often stand by helplessly
as it destroys them. They simply don't know what else to do. The Bible says,
&quot;My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge...&quot; (Hos. 4:6).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But you know. Your hope is in
Jesus. Trust Him. And tell the world--their hope is in Him too.</p>
