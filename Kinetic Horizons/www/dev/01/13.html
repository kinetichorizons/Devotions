<h1>In Good and Bad Times </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.2pt;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:1.7pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Because he hath set his love upon me,
therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my
name. He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in
trouble; I will deliver him, and honor him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:1.7pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Psalm 91:14-15</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:4.3pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God is called by many names. He
is the Lord, our Healer, our Provider, our Banner, and our Righteousness. He
also promises to be our Deliverer. In this troubled world that may very well be
what we need Him to be most often.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But there are many believers who
never experience God's mighty delivering power because, instead of walking
closely with Him day by day, they wait until danger strikes to call upon Him.
That just doesn't work. If you want God to rescue you in the bad times, you
have to fellowship with Him in the good times. Why? Because God responds to
faith. Our faith, not our need, is what causes Him to act on our behalf. And
we'll never be able to develop that kind of faith, that kind of trust and
confidence in Him, if we don't spend enough time with Him to get to know Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>First John 3:20-22 tells us that
we have confidence toward God when we do the things that are pleasing in His
sight. If we only serve God half-heartedly, then we will not have confidence in
Him to deliver us from trouble. When danger surrounds us, instead of being
filled with faith, we'll find ourselves paralyzed with fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Love and serve God with your
whole heart. Walk closely with Him in the good times. Then, when you need Him
to be your Deliverer, you'll know without a doubt you can trust Him to care for
you!</p>
