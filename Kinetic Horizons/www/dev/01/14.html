<h1>Under Your Feet </h1>

unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, Until I make thy foes thy footstool.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Even though Satan lost all his
authority on this earth the day Jesus rose from the dead, for the past 2,000
years he's been running around as a spiritual outlaw--continuing to kill, steal
from, and destroy all who will let him. But, he's not going to be able to do
that much longer. There's coming a day when he's going to be put out of
business completely. There's coming a day when the evil he's done here on earth
will be put totally underfoot by the power of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Most believers know that's true.
They've shouted and rejoiced over it--but they haven't really understood how
it's going to happen. They haven't realized that they are the foot that's going
to trample down the works of the devil!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus is the Head of the Church.
You and I are the feet. We are the ones who are going to take His authority and
power and stomp on sin and sickness and every other demonic thing in this
earth. We are the ones God is going to use, as Acts 2:35 says, to make Jesus'
enemies His footstool.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's what Jesus was telling us
when He said, &quot;Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
creature...lay hands on the sick and...cast out devils&quot; (Mark 16:1518). He
was saying, &quot;Go ye and be My foot.&quot; He was saying, 'All power and
authority has been given unto Me, both in heaven and in earth. Therefore, you
take it and use it to put the devil under.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But instead of obeying Him, we've
waited around wondering when God was going to do something about this mess here
on earth. We've sat around wondering why it's taking so long for Jesus to come
back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We're the reason it's taking so
long! Jesus is waiting on you and me. He's waiting on us to step out in His
power, put the devil in his place, and win the world. He's waiting on us to
drop our silly doctrinal differences and get busy doing what God said we would
do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Bible says that one can put a
thousand to flight and two can put ten thousand to flight. Every time we get
together, we increase our strength astronomically. If we'd just get together
and figure out who we are, if we'd realize that we're the feet of Jesus, we
could kick Satan out of earth's affairs with ease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:18.45pt;margin-bottom:
5.85pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you want to hasten Jesus' return? Then quit
sitting around staring at the clouds! Start stomping around in the Spirit.
Start putting the works of the serpent under your feet and we can wrap this
thing up and go home to glory real soon! <b>Scripture Reading:</b> Genesis
3:1-14</p>
