<h1>Don't Worry </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

not worry and be anxious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2pt;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:1.15pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;

text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God is vehemently against worry.
Jesus preached against it. Paul preached against it. The whole Bible preaches
against worry because it was designed by Satan to produce stress, strain, and
death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Yet many of us still act as if
it's an option, as if we're free to worry if we want to. But we're not!
Worrying is a sin. It's one of those things the Word of God directly commands
us not to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What are you supposed to do then
with all the concerns you have about your problems? In 1 Peter 5:7, God says
you should &quot;cast them all upon Him.&quot; All. Not 75 percent of them. Not
all of them but the ones about your kids. All of them!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Your confession every morning
should be, &quot;I do not have a care in this world because I've cast every one
of them onto my Lord.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Let me illustrate how that works.
Let's say you were standing about 20 feet away from me and I tossed my car keys
to you. If someone else were to come to me and say, &quot;Brother Copeland, I
need the keys to your car. I need to use it.&quot; I would say, &quot;I can't
help you. I cast my keys over on him. I don't have them anymore.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's what you need to do with
your worries. You need to cast them over on the Lord and not take them back. If
Satan brings a worried thought to your mind, saying, &quot;What if this
terrible thing happens?&quot; then you can tell him to talk to God about it.
It's in His hands, not yours!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Once you do that, changes will
start to take place in your life. Problems you've been fretting about for years
will start being solved. You'll no longer be tying God's hands with your
worrying. His power can begin to operate because you've acted in faith and cast
your cares on Him!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Remember, though, God will not
take your cares away from you. You have to give them to Him. Then you have to
replace those worries with the Word. You are the one who has to keep your
thoughts under control. But you can do it. The Greater One dwells within you.
He is able to put you over. Commit to it. You'll never have to worry again.</p>
