style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>And as ye go, preach, saying, The
kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the
dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>There are those who've said that
some of the diseases that are on the rampage right now, diseases such as AIDS,
are God's way of punishing immoral people today. There is absolutely no
scriptural basis for that!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God does not bring disease on the
human race. In fact, if there's anybody in heaven and earth who hates it, it's
Jesus. The devil is the one who's trying to tell us otherwise. He's promoting a
lie, trying to get us to believe God is the one who's inflicting these diseases
on people because he knows that if the victims believe that, it will drive them
further from God than ever. And that's his aim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It's time you and I as believers
put a stop to that lie. Some time ago, the Lord spoke to my heart and told me
so. He said, &quot;Reach out to those who are suffering. Let them know I didn't
do this to them. Let them know I'm their Deliverer!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That word was not just for me, it
was for the whole Body of Christ. We need to tell people who've been afflicted
with AIDS or any such disease that Jesus is Lord over it. We need to tell them
that God loves them dearly, and He has the desire and the power to heal them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God is not responsible for the
suffering we're seeing around us. That's just a nasty lie the devil is passing
around. And if you and I do our job right, very soon another word is going to
start spreading through the streets. The news is going to get out that Jesus
Christ is not their captor, He's the One who can set them free!</p>
