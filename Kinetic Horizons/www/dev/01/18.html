<h1>Get Yourself Together </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When it comes to faith, a lot of
believers feel like they have one foot nailed to the ground. No matter how hard
they try, they just can't seem to make any progress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you'll watch them, you can see
why. They literally haven't &quot;gotten themselves together.&quot; One minute
they'll be telling you, &quot;Oh yes, amen, I believe the Word,&quot; and the
next minute they'll be spouting unbelief like it's going out of style. &quot;I
know God says He'll prosper us, but I'll tell you what, my business is doing so
badly, it's about to give me ulcers. I can't sleep at night for
worrying.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Dig a little deeper and you may
find out that they've pulled their actions out of line with the Word as well.
&quot;Well, you understand, brother, I can't possibly tithe with my income like
it is. I'd go under!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Faith just won't work for a
person like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You see, you're a triune being.
You are a spirit. You have a soul, which consists of your mind, will, and
emotions. And you live in a body. Each of those areas has a specific role to
play in your faith walk. You have to get all three in agreement before you can
go anywhere at all!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Start by feeding your spirit on
the Word of God. Just like the body produces physical strength when you nourish
it with food, the spirit produces spiritual strength when you nourish it with
the Word. That spiritual strength is called faith. Develop that faith, and
instead of your spirit being dominated by the other two areas, it will be the
one in charge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Next, bring your soul in line.
Set your mind on &quot;things above.&quot; Meditate on the Word until your
thoughts begin to agree with it. Keep your attention on it until even your
emotions yield.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Finally, bring your body in line.
Once you truly get your spirit and soul established on the Word, that won't be
hard. The body is a follower, not a leader. It will do whatever you train it to
do. Begin teaching your body to act on the truth you've planted in your mind
and spirit, and it will follow right along.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't try to walk in faith with
your foot nailed to the ground. Get yourself together! Bring your spirit, soul,
and body in harmony--and the Word will take you as far as you want to go.</p>
