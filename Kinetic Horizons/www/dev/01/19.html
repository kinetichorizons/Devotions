<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We have what we say. As
believers, we know that's a vital biblical truth. We can see it in Mark 11:23,
Matthew 21:21, James 3:2, and many other verses. Yet we often let it slip.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We allow ourselves to begin
talking like the world instead of talking the Word. And eventually we get what
we've been asking for--a big mess.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If that's happened to you,
remember, whatever you have in your life is a product of what you've been
saying. In order to change what you have, you must change what's coming out of
your mouth. To head your life in a different direction--from death to life,
sickness to health, failure to success--you must take charge of your words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's a lot easier said than
done. But that's the key: It must be said in order to be done!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>How do you start?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>First, realize that it can't be
done just in the natural. This is a spiritual law, so it must be handled with
spiritual power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>James 3:7-8 says the tongue can't
be tamed with the same power with which man tames animals. It takes God's
wisdom from above. God's Word is His wisdom (Prov. 2:6). He also said His words
are spirit and life. That means it takes God's words to tame our tongues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Second, repent before God for
ever allowing your tongue to be used by anyone except the Holy Spirit. Then
give Jesus your tongue. Be determined to speak His words of love, faith, joy,
peace, and grace. Words of faith stop the fiery darts of hell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The third thing to do is what
Jesus said in Mark 4:24: Take heed, or listen, to what you hear. Listen to
yourself! Think, Do I want what I just said to come to pass? If the answer is
no, then stop and correct yourself right then. Replace those negative words
with praise (Ephesians 5:4).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you've gotten sloppy about
what you say, change your course today by changing your words. Ask God to help
you set a watch over your mouth (Ps. 141:3). Put the power that's in your
tongue to work for you instead of against you. Stop using it to make messes,
and start using it to make miracles. There is a miracle in your mouth! <b>Scripture
Reading:</b> James 3:1-13</p>
