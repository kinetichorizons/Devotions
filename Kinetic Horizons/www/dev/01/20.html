<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>One day I was walking along a
highway through a park praying and I asked a simple question, &quot;Lord, what
do You want me to tell Your people?&quot; Without a moment's hesitation, these
words came ringing through my spirit and my mind:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Tell them how much I love them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>They were so filled with love and
compassion that it defies words to express it. For days afterward all I could
think of was 1 John 4:16. &quot;And we have known and believed the love that
God hath to us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We've read about God's love.
We've heard about it. But I don't think many of us have really believed it. If
we did, it would totally change everything about us and everything around us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It's that love that caused Jesus
to lay down His life for us and to experience for Himself all the pains and
weaknesses we experience. It's that love that says to us, even when we feel so
unworthy, &quot;Come to Me and get what you need. Don't be shy about it. I've
been there. Come boldly to the throne of grace that you may obtain mercy and
find grace to help in time of need.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Think about it. God is in love
with you--so in love, He's given you everything He has! He's given you all the
healing, all the wisdom, all the wealth, all the strength you could ever need. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;But what about my terrible
past?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's what His mercy is for!
It's taken care of your past. It's covered every sin and failure you ever had.
All you have to do now is believe and receive His love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What a shame it is that people
suffer at the hands of sickness and disease and every other cursed thing just because
they can't believe the love God has for them. Don't let that happen to you.
Learn to believe the love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Believe the love God has for you.
It's already been released in the blood of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Believe the love. It's already
been released in Jesus' Name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Believe the love. It's already
been released in His Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Meditate that scripture over and
over. Say it to yourself again and again all day, &quot;I believe the love
Jesus has for me.&quot; Once it gets down into your heart, you'll never be the
same again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.7pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><b>Scripture Reading:</b>
