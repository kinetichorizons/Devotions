<h1>Live Like Jesus </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:.9pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>But
[Christ Jesus] made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
servant, and was made in the likeness of men.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:.9pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>Philippians
2:7</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:3.7pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The truth of this verse hasn't really dawned on most
people. They mistakenly think that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus was able to work wonders,
to perform miracles, and to live above sin because He had divine powers that we
don't have. Thus, they have never really aspired to live like He lived.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;Oh my,&quot; they say with
great humility, &quot;I could never live like Jesus did. After all, He had an
advantage. He was God!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>They don't realize that when
Jesus came to earth, He voluntarily gave up that advantage, living His life
here not as God but as a man. He had no innate supernatural powers. He had no
ability to perform miracles until after He was anointed by the Holy Spirit as
recorded in Luke 3:22. He worked wonders, not by His own power but by the power
of the Father, saying, &quot;The Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the
works&quot; (John 14:10).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>And when He prayed, He prayed not
as a divine One who had authority as God, but as a man who walked obediently
with God. And, as Hebrews 5:7 says, &quot;His prayers were heard not because of
His deity, but because of His reverence toward God&quot; (AMP).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus, the divine Son of God, set
aside the privileges and powers of deity for a time and lived as a man on
earth. Once you grasp that, it will absolutely thrill your soul! Why? Because
it means that you, as a reborn child of God, filled with the same Holy Spirit
as Jesus was, have the same opportunity to live as He lived on earth. In fact,
that is exactly what He intends. In John 17:18 He said to the Father,
&quot;Just as You sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the
world.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus has sent you into the world
to live as He lived. Through the new birth, He's enabled you to exchange the
sinful nature of Adam for the sinless nature of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He's given you the ability and
the command to live above sin, to live in fellowship with the Father, to preach
the gospel, to heal the sick, to raise the dead, to cast out demons, and to
make disciples.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Once you realize that, you'll
throw off the shackles of doubt that have held you back. You'll begin to live as
Jesus meant for you to live--not as a sin-ridden son of fallen man, but as a
reborn child of the Most High God. Then those around you will actually begin to
see Jesus--in you.</p>
