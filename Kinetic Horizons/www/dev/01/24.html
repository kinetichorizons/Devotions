<h1>Do Your Own Praying </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:1.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%'>Is any one among you afflicted -ill-treated, suffering evil?
He should pray.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Greek word translated
afflicted doesn't mean the result of sickness and disease. It means
&quot;troubled.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you're in trouble, you need to
pray. That's what the Word says. Notice it didn't say your pastor needs to pray
for you or your friends need to pray for you. It says you need to pray.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Too often we try to find a quick
fix to our problems by asking everyone else to pray for us. There's nothing
wrong, of course, with having others pray for you, but you'll never get your
life to a place of permanent victory until you begin to pray yourself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The biggest church in the world
is in Seoul, Korea. It's pastored by Dr. David Cho, and the last I heard, it
had more than 700,000 members. How did that church grow to be so large?
According to Dr. Cho, the key is prayer. Not just his prayers but the prayers
of his people. Praying is a way of life in that church. They have a place
called Prayer Mountain where thousands of people come every day to pray.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I once heard Dr. Cho's
mother-in-law on television talking about the emphasis they put on prayer. She
said that when their church members are in trouble, when they have marriage
problems or problems in their personal life, before anything else is done,
those church members are told to go and fast and pray for 24 hours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We need to do more of that here
in our churches in the United States. We need to quit training our people to
run around asking others to pray for them and train them instead to do their
own praying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You see, if I pray for God to
solve one problem for you, you may enjoy success for a while, but then another
problem will come along because you'll still be making the same old mistakes
that got you in trouble the first time. But if you buckle down and do that
praying for yourself, if you discipline yourself to start searching out the
things of the Spirit, you'll get permanent answers. You'll learn how to make
adjustments in your life that will keep those problems from cropping up again. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you have made Jesus your Lord,
you have access to the throne of Almighty God. He has every solution to every
problem you'll ever have, and He's just waiting for you to come to Him, so He
can give you the answer. It may take some private time alone with Him for you
to hear it, but He will never disappoint you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't depend on others to do your
praying for you. Go personally to the throne of God today.</p>
