<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Some years back, I was praying
and walking the floor of our little house in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I was walking up
and down confessing 1 John 4:4, &quot;Greater is He that is in me, than he that
is in the world.&quot; Greater is He.... Greater is He.... Suddenly, revelation
knowledge welled up in me and I knew, Oh! God is in me!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It hit me like somebody walked up
and slapped me with a wet rag. It just shook me awake. I started to stomp
grandly around that old house. All of a sudden, I wasn't just a poor preacher
living in a shack anymore! I was the dwelling place of the Most High God! That
changed my thinking about so many things. I looked at my hands and it hit me.
His fingers are in my fingers! I looked at my legs. His legs are in my legs.
His feet are in my feet! If I walk into danger, He walks into danger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Now, when I hear people say,
&quot;Brother Copeland, my prayers aren't getting any higher than the
ceiling,&quot; I want to say, &quot;Higher than the ceiling? They don't need to
get any higher than your nose! He's inside you! The Author of your prayers, the
Author of your faith, Jesus of Nazareth has taken residency inside you.
Hallelujah!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Some people think you don't get
filled with the Spirit until you receive the Baptism in the Holy Ghost. But
that's not so. The Holy Spirit came into you when you made Jesus Lord of your
life. He came into you when you were born again. Getting baptized in the Holy
Spirit is another thing. It's when the power of the Holy Ghost comes upon you
to empower you for service (Acts 1:8).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That means even if you've just
been born again two seconds, Jesus is in you! He's living there, and He will be
from now on. Can you fathom that? If you'll spend some time thinking about it
and meditating on it, you can receive revelation of it just like I did. It will
start growing in your spirit and eventually change your whole life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;As God hath said, I will
dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my
people&quot; (2 Cor. 6:16). Jesus is in you. That's the most glorious truth in
the Word of God. Let that truth come alive in you today.</p>
