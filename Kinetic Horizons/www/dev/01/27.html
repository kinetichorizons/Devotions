<h1>God Wants You Well </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>For I will restore health
unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord Jeremiah 30:17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:4.95pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God wants you well! He wants you
healthy and strong in every single area of your life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He wants you to be spiritually
strong. Strong in faith. Strong in the Word. Strong in redemption. Strong in
the love of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He wants you to be well in your
mind, to be strong and stable emotionally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He wants you to have a healthy
will, a will that's aligned with His will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He wants your body to be well. He
wants you free from the bondages of pain, sickness, and care. Free from the
worries and woes of this earthly life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Your heavenly Father wants you
well!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What's more, in this day and
hour, He needs you well. He needs you living in victory and healing so that you
can teach others how to do it too. We're stepping into a time when that kind of
knowledge is an absolute necessity. There's no more time for the Body of Christ
to limp along, uninformed and unprepared for the devil's attacks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In fact, here's what the Lord has
told me:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The further you go, the more
dangerous things in the earth will become. People will have to grow in the
realities of redemption and the &quot;how to's&quot; of living by faith in order
to live in the great, overcoming way I have planned for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus gave Himself in death so
that we could be well. He was raised in life, ever making intercession for us
now so that we can be well. And He wants us to be healthy and strong as a
witness in these last days to a world that's filled with terror--a witness of
His love, His grace, and His power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Receive Jesus' healing power in
every area of your life. Start applying it by faith right now. Commit yourself
to getting well and growing strong in every area of your life today!</p>
