<h1>Don't Be Stony Ground </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.4pt;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:3.9pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center'>And
these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have
heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness; And have no root in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.4pt;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:3.9pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center'>themselves,
and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth
for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:3.9pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center'>Mark
4:16-17</p>

text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>There seems to be an abundance of
&quot;stony ground&quot; Christians these days. Initially, they get excited
about the Word of God. They'll hear a message on prosperity, for instance, and
they'll go home saying, &quot;Hallelujah! I'm going to prosper in the Name of
Jesus!&quot; But then, somehow, things don't work out like they thought they
should.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Their bank balance doesn't double
overnight. They go through some disappointments. They suffer some criticism.
Then, before you know it, their faith has withered away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you don't want that to happen
to you, make up your mind right now that you're not going to let the rough
times defeat you. Decide now that you're going to hang onto the Word even when
the persecutions and afflictions come--because, I can guarantee you, they will
come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When you decide to walk by faith,
you don't get rid of trials. You learn to overcome them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When you let the Word of God get
down into your heart, you're going to learn more about the devil than you ever
wanted to know because he's going to do his best to see to it that the Word is
unfruitful in you. He's going to be trying to mess you up every time you turn
around. You'll have problems, but the difference is now you have the
answer--the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Thank God, however, through
Christ Jesus you have the power to defeat Satan. When he brings problems and
disappointments your way, you don't have to lie down and let them steam roll
over you. Just keep fighting the good fight of faith until you win.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you get knocked down, get back
up and say, &quot;Look here, devil, I'm not going to let you steal the Word out
of my heart. It's in there and I'm meditating on it; I'm saying it with my
mouth; and I'm acting on it until God's blessings overtake me. If you don't
believe me, just hide and watch!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you'll take that attitude, no
matter what that devil does, he'll never make a &quot;stony ground&quot;
Christian out of you!</p>
