<h1>Just Do It </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.4pt;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:1.9pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>And
the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had
healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in
which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the
sabbath day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:1.9pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Luke
13:14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:4.65pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Religion is dangerous. Religion
would rather debate about healing than see somebody healed. Religion would
rather argue about deliverance than see somebody set free.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You can see an example of that in
Luke 13. Jesus healed a woman who had been bowed over for 18 years. Think of
it, a dear old woman--a daughter of Abraham Jesus called her--set free after
being bound by the devil for nearly two decades. You'd think the temple rulers
would have been rejoicing at what Jesus had done. But, no! They were angry
because He'd done it on the wrong day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you know what's worse? Those
very same religious leaders who criticized Jesus for healing on the Sabbath
could have ministered healing to that woman themselves on any of the other six
days of the week if they'd cared enough to do it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's why Jesus was so indignant
with them. They had the same covenant of Abraham as Jesus. But their religion
had kept that woman bound instead of setting her free. It always does.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Remember that next time someone
tries to get you sidetracked into a religious debate about healing or
deliverance. If someone needs to be delivered from a demon, just do it! Don't
get all hung up on theological questions about where the demon is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;Is it in his body? Or his
brain? Or his spirit? Or his pocket?&quot; While you're arguing about questions
like that, the demon will be driving the poor guy up the wall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The question isn't, &quot;Where
is the demon?&quot; The question is, &quot;Why haven't we gotten this man
delivered? He's our blood brother in the Name of Jesus and he ought to be
free!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Once you start asking that
question, you won't care whether that demon is inside or outside, hovering over
or sitting under. All you'll care about is getting that person free!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's the difference between
religion and the love of God. Religion argues. Love acts. Choose love today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.85pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><b>Scripture Reading:</b>
