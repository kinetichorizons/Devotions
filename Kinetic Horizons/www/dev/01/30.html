<h1>Make His Word the Last Word </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:111.1pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-106.2pt'>I am Alpha and
Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was,
and which is to come, the Almighty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:1.45pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Revelation 1:8</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:4.8pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus is the beginning and the
ending. He is the Almighty. When He told us that in the Book of Revelation, He
wasn't just giving us a general piece of information about Himself. He was
giving us a powerful truth we can apply now, today!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Let me show you how. He said He
is the beginning. So no matter what challenge or situation you may be facing
right now, you need to start with Him. John 1:1 says Jesus is the Word. That
means, if you're going to start with Jesus, you're going to start with the
Word. Don't do anything until you find out what the Word has to say about it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Then, stay on the Word. As
Colossians 1:23 says, &quot;Continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be
not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Continue in the faith. The only
way the devil can defeat you is to pressure you into throwing away the Word.
Everything he does, every challenge he brings you is intended to make you doubt
the Word of God. So don't let go of the Word, no matter what may happen. Settle
it with God in prayer and stay with it forever. It is written!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Then end with the Word. Jesus
said He was the first and the last. That means the word of your doctor is not
the last word. Even the word of your pastor is not the last word. The Word of
Jesus is the last Word!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Remember this: You are now what
the Word says you are. You can do what the Word says you can do. And you can
have what the Word says you can have. Begin to believe that. Begin to say it
out loud in faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Now shout the victory. Yes, now!
You don't have to wait to see the outcome to celebrate. You have Jesus' Word on
the matter, so you know beyond any doubt that your breakthrough is coming. Once
you've settled yourself on Him, you can be assured that He will have the last
word!</p>
