<h1>Four Words That Work </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.05pt;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:.45pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>Therefore
I say unto you, What things so ever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye
receive them, and ye shall have them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-2.3pt;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:.45pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>Mark
11:24</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Believing. That's the key to
everything in the kingdom of God. It's the way we tap into the very power of
Almighty God. Most of us know that. But do we know how to put it into action?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Actually it's so simple, it's
startling. It's as simple as saying, &quot;I believe I receive.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Something happens in your spirit
when you say those words. I don't understand how, but it does. I don't
understand how my digestive system knows what to do when I swallow something,
but it does. All I have to do is take a bite of food and it goes to work. I
don't have to make it happen. I don't have to feel it happen. It just happens.
That's the way the body is made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In much the same way, when you
feed on God's precious promises and &quot;swallow&quot; them into your spirit
by saying, &quot;I believe I receive,&quot; faith is released. You don't have
to make it happen. You don't have to feel it happen. It just happens. The
reborn spirit is made that way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When you constantly say with your
mouth, &quot;I believe I receive my healing&quot; or &quot;I believe I receive
my financial needs met,&quot; and then quote the scriptures that back those
things, faith is released to bring power to bear on those needs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As Dr. Kenneth Hagin says, you
need to &quot;keep the switch of faith turned on.&quot; And Gloria and I have
discovered that speaking out that phrase, &quot;I believe I receive,&quot; is
one way to do it. We say it when we pray. We say it when we praise God. We say
it when we read the Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We especially say it in the face
of darkness when it looks like we're not receiving. When everything looks the
worst, we say it the loudest. I believe I receive!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you want to activate your
faith today? Then make these four key words the most important words in your
vocabulary. Use them every day. You'll soon discover, just as we did...they
work!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.85pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><b>Scripture Reading:</b>
Mark 11:12-24</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
