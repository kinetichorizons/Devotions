23:1-2</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Have you ever thought about David
and wondered how a shepherd boy could become a man after God's own heart? A man
so strong in spirit that God chose him to be king of Israel? I have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In fact, I asked God about it,
and He showed me that revelation was what turned David into such a spiritual
powerhouse--revelation that came to him through hours of thinking about the
things of God. I imagine the day he wrote Psalm 23 he was just sitting and
singing praises to God and meditating on His goodness. Just fellowshipping with
Him when suddenly the anointing of the Lord came upon him and he said,
&quot;The Lord is my Shepherd!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Suddenly he thought about the
sheep he watched over as a boy, I faced death for those sheep. I led them where
pastures were green and waters were cool, clean, deep, and peaceful. He kept on
meditating on that until it started to thrill him. When the lion and the bear
came, didn't He prepare a table before me in the presence of those enemies? He
gave me victory. &quot;My God! My God will fight for me. The Lord is my
Shepherd! I shall not want!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That revelation welled up in
David so strong that the devil couldn't beat it out of him. So when Goliath
tried to make a fool out of Israel, David went after him. Goliath was able to
scare off everyone else, but he couldn't shake David because he had a
revelation inside him that said, &quot;Yea, though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for my God is with me.&quot; That
revelation enabled David to say, &quot;I come against you in the name of the
Lord of Hosts&quot; and to send a rock sailing into that giant's brain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Is the devil out to destroy you?
Do what David did. Meditate on God and His Word. Sing praises to your King.
Fellowship with Him until the revelation of who He is in you starts to thrill
your soul. Then tell the devil, &quot;You're not going to kill me. The Lord is
my Shepherd!&quot; Hit him with the rock of revelation knowledge, and you'll
knock him flat every time.</p>
