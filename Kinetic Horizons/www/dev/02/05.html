destroy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Considering how much the devil
hates people and how dead set he is on destroying them, it's no wonder we see
so much tragedy and disaster in the world. In fact, it's amazing that we don't
see more!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I asked the Lord about that one
time and He told me it takes the realm of darkness a long time to set up major
disasters. Take the aviation industry, for example. It's highly regulated and
works hard at policing itself because safety is its product. You take a highly
regulated system like that and the devil has to work terribly hard to cause
disasters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He can't just come roaring in and
rip things up any time he wants to. If he could, he'd knock every plane out of
the sky tonight. But he can't do it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Why? Because he's bound. The
Bible says he's bound to things that are common to man. He has to line up
certain things in this natural, human realm before he can lay a finger on you.
He has to use people to get his work done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But, bless God, we're not bound
to what's common to man. We're free to use what's common to God! We fight our
warfare with uncommon weapons. What does that mean? It means you ought to have
the devil wrapped up and sewed up. You ought to put him in a sack with a ribbon
on top.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The devil can't cause disaster in
your life unless he has been given place. He can't come in and start destroying
and stealing from you unless he can get you into a place of sin, doubt,
ignorance, or disobedience. So if he's been giving you trouble, ask the Holy
Spirit to show you where you've let those things in. Then repent and get rid of
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Once you've done that, pull out
the weapons God has given you and fire away with both barrels. Pull out the
Word. Pull out prayer. Pull out faith and use it to tie the devil in knots. Use
the uncommon power of God to keep him bound and he won't be able to put
anything over on you.</p>
