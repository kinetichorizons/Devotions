<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When I was a new Christian, it
was almost impossible for me to live at peace with anyone! Almost every time I
opened my mouth, I said something ugly. I was constantly hurting the people I
was close to. In fact, I spoke more harshly to them than to anyone else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I criticized Gloria's driving so
much that she nearly refused to drive while I was with her. I criticized my
children so much that they began to avoid me. I didn't want to be so
insensitive, but I couldn't help it. I had a well-developed habit of speaking
harshly and didn't know how to change it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Then I found Ephesians 5:4. It said,
&quot;[Let there be] no coarse, stupid, or flippant talk; these things are out
of place; you should rather be thanking God&quot; (New</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>English Bible). When I read that,
I realized I needed to replace the words I was used to saying with words of
thanksgiving. That would solve my problem. After all, I couldn't speak harshly
and thank God at the same time. I couldn't criticize those around me if I had a
thankful attitude about them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I immediately decided to put this
principle to work in my life. Rushing into my son's room one day ready to
lambaste him about something he had done, I recognized my old behavior pattern.
I just stopped and said to myself, &quot;The Word says this kind of behavior is
out of place, so I am going to stop and thank God.&quot; I wasn't nearly as
angry after I spent a few minutes praising and thanking the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you've developed the habit of
speaking harshly, start changing that habit today. When someone crosses you on
the job, at school, or wherever, and you're tempted to tear into them with
cruel words, stop! Then take a few moments to give thanks and praise to God.
Once you begin thinking about how good God is, more often than not, those
harsh, angry words will just slip away unspoken.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Instead of using your tongue to
tear people down, train it to lift God's praises up. Then living at peace with
others will come easily to you!</p>
