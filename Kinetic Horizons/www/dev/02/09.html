line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you know what Jesus was really
talking about when He said those words? He was talking about the mourning of
the intercessor. He was teaching about the comfort that comes to the
intercessor when he is assured by the Holy Spirit that he has prayed through.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>To pray through means &quot;to
break through the barriers that have stopped the work of God in the lives of
others.&quot; It means using your spiritual armor to push back the forces of
darkness that surround them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>There's a desperate need for
believers who are willing to do that today. There's a need for intercessors who
will go before God and reach out for His mercy and compassion for the sinner,
for the sick, and for this downcast world. For prayer warriors who will stick
with it until they have the assurance inside, in their spirits, that every
barrier is broken and every area of bondage has been abolished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God is looking for intercessors
like that--and there are certain things that won't happen on this earth until
He finds them. There are blessings and moves of God that won't come until
someone gives birth to those things by prayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Even the Lord Jesus Himself was ushered into the earth by
intercession.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Remember Simeon and Anna? They
were both intercessors, prayer warriors of God. They'd spent years in spiritual
mourning, praying for the Messiah to come. But when they were done, they
experienced the comfort of the Holy Spirit. For when they saw Jesus as a tiny
baby in the temple, they recognized Him and rejoiced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you're wondering if you're one
of those who's been called to intercession, then you probably are. God is
calling believers everywhere to experience that unique kind of mourning and comfort
that only the intercessor knows. He's calling you to lay down your life for
others through prayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Somewhere in the world, someone
needs you to pray them through. Spend some time on your knees today.</p>
