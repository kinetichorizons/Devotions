<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.1pt;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:1.6pt;text-align:center'>So [Israel] came up to
Baal-perazim, and David smote the [Philistines] there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.1pt;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:1.6pt;text-align:center'>Then David said, God
has broken my enemies by my hand, like the bursting forth of waters; therefore
they called the name of that place Baal-perazim(Lord of breaking through).</p>

line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Like the bursting forth of
waters. I love that phrase! It paints such a powerful and accurate picture of a
breakthrough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you remember the story of the
little boy who saw a leak in the dam and plugged up the hole with his finger?
He knew that the force of the water flowing through that one tiny hole would
have enlarged the leak with every second that passed. And, as the dam gave way
to the pressure, that tiny trickle would have quickly become a raging flood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As you reach out your hand in
faith, expect God to break in upon your enemies just like He did for David.
That's how your breakthrough will come like the bursting forth of waters!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Punch one little hole in that
wall of problems, and no devilish dam will hold you back. Dig one tiny hole in
it with your faith and with the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Then keep tearing away at that
hole by speaking out that faith day after day. Don't quit! Because God's forces
are backed up behind you like an ocean of spiritual water. Each time you speak
a word of faith, they leak through. The more you speak and the more you pray,
the bigger that leak will get.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Begin your breakthrough right
now. Say, &quot;Lord Jesus, I rejoice today that You are Lord of my
breakthrough. I thank You that the flood of Your power is about to sweep
through my life. I know there is no problem that can stand against it. Poverty
can't stand against it. Family problems can't stand against it. Nothing the
devil can do can stop my victory. I praise You for it NOW! Amen.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Keep praying that. Keep believing
that. And before long, the forces of God will come bursting through,
demolishing every obstacle in their path!</p>
