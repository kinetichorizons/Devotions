<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Few things in the Bible have
created more fuss than the issue of speaking in tongues. Churches have split
over it. People have been persecuted for doing it. People have even been killed
for it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Who's behind all the trouble?
Satan himself. He's so frightened of our ability to pray in tongues that he's
continually trying to steal it from us through persecution and strife.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You see, the devil knows (even if
we don't) that praying in tongues is the only way you and I can pray beyond
what we know. It's the tool God has given us to use to tap into the mind of the
Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When we pray in tongues, we
activate the Holy Spirit within us and He begins to teach us and enlighten us.
If you want to see an example of what praying in tongues can do, look at the
Apostle Paul. He said he prayed in tongues more than anyone in the whole
Corinthian church and he was responsible for writing most of the New
Testament!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Another example is the first
church at Jerusalem. They didn't yet have any of the New Testament to read. They
couldn't turn to Ephesians and find out what God's plan was for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>They just had to pray in tongues
until the revelation light of God dawned in their hearts. That's all the
equipment they had. So they used it and turned the world upside down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Some years ago God began
directing me to spend an hour a day praying in tongues. After I did it awhile,
I began to talk to other Christians who'd been directed to do the same thing.
God was speaking to believers all over the world to spend time praying in the Spirit.

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>If you haven't made a commitment to
spend some time each day praying in tongues, make one now. Set aside all the
disagreements and confusion the devil has stirred up</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>about it and just say,
&quot;Lord, I'm going to do it. I don't care what the devil says. I don't care
what any man says. I know You have plans for me that are so good my human mind
hasn't even conceived them--things that are beyond what I can ask or think. And
by praying in the Spirit, I'm going to receive them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:14.95pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't let the distractions of the devil disturb you. Tap
into the mind of God. Speak forth His wisdom. Pray in the Spirit today.</p>
