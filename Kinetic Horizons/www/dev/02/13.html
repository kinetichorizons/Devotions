<h1>You Can Open That Door<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:9.65pt;

knock, and it shall be opened unto you. Matthew 7:7</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.85pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:14.0pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>How long has it been since you were backed into a corner,
hemmed in by a seemingly insurmountable problem? Some spend years trying to
work their way out of financial binds only to end up more bound by debt than
ever. Others work doggedly on marriages that, despite their best efforts,
deteriorate from year to year. Still others fight battles against fear or
depression, drug addiction or disease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:14.0pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Deep within our hearts, each of us knows there must be an
answer to the problems we face. But often it seems to be out of reach, hidden
behind a door that's locked tightly against us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:14.0pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>What I want you to know today, however, is this: WE CAN
OPEN THAT DOOR! Jesus Himself has given us the keys.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:14.0pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Right now you may be facing a situation that looks utterly
hopeless, but God has a key ring full of keys that will unlock any situation.
He has the keys that open the doors for you spiritually and physically,
financially and emotionally. No matter how hard the devil tries to trap you, if
you'll get hold of the right key, you can find your way out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:14.0pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>God's Word is full of keys of kingdom principles--keys to
bind the devil's operations and keys to loose yourself from his snares. God has
a key that will unravel any knot that the devil can tie. He also has a key that
will lock up the devil's operation so tightly that he won't be able to move.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:14.0pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Remember this: There's no situation so dark and so cleverly
designed by the forces of darkness that there is not a kingdom key that will
unlock it with kingdom power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:14.0pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>There is an answer to your situation. So keep digging for
it. If you've been digging in the Word of God in one spot and haven't found
your answer, then look at another chapter, a different verse. Keep digging
until you find the key. Keep knocking at every door until you find the one that
opens.</p>
