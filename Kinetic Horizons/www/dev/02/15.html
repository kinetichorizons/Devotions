<h1>A Proven Success </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:.25pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:104%'>And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against
heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. But the
father said to his</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.45pt;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:.95pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>servants,
Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and
shoes on his feet....For this my son...was lost, and is found.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.1pt;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:.95pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>Luke
15:21-22, 24</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-left:3.75pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Prove yourself. In today's world,
that's what you constantly feel you have to do, right? On the job, among
friends, even at home you're always working to win the approval you need.
Working to convince those around you that you deserve the salary, the
friendship, and even the love they give you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Is there any escape?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You better believe there is! It's
called grace. Unearned and undeserved favor and acceptance. And there's only
one place you can find it--in the heart of God Himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>There's no better picture of
God's grace in action than in the story of the prodigal son. Few of us today
can really feel the impact of that story like those first Jewish listeners
Jesus told it to. You see, by their standards the prodigal son had committed
some of the most despicable acts possible. He'd not only taken advantage of his
father and spent his inheritance in riotous living, he'd left the nation of
Israel and made covenant with a foreigner--a pig farmer! That was as low as you
could get.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In their eyes, that boy's
rebellion was so serious his father's only recourse was to disown him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But that's not what this father
did! He welcomed his repentant son home with open arms. He offered him
grace--unmerited favor--that was based on the father's love rather than the
son's performance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Next time you catch yourself
struggling to make up to God for something you've done wrong, working to win
His approval, let the story of the prodigal son set you free. Let it remind you
that, in spite of your sins, your Father has received you with open arms. He's
put a robe of righteousness on your back and His signet ring on your hand. He's
put the shoes of sonship on your feet!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.65pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you feel unworthy of all that? God hasn't based His
relationship with you on your worthiness. He's based it on His love for you.
You don't have to struggle to prove yourself to Him. As far as He's concerned,
you're a proven success.</p>
