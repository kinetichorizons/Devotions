and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and
be exceeding glad:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.65pt;
margin-bottom:13.9pt;margin-left:26.0pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:-16.15pt'>for
great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were
before you. Matthew 5:11-12</p>

margin-bottom:12.8pt;margin-left:4.7pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When persecution comes, don't sit
around whining about it. Don't waste your time feeling sorry for yourself.
Despite what you may think, that persecution hasn't come because the devil gets
his kicks out of picking on you. It comes because you've become a threat to
him. It comes because you've put the Word in your heart, and he knows that if
he doesn't get it out, you're going to cause him more trouble than he can
handle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So rejoice! Heavy duty
persecution means you've made it to the big league. It means the devil is
taking you so seriously that he's sending in his best players in an effort to
get you out of the game!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The players that make it to the
Superbowl don't look for some way out of it, do they? They don't say,
&quot;Boy, I sure wish I didn't have to be in that Superbowl game. Those guys
are the biggest, meanest players in the country. &quot;Maybe I'll get sick and
I won't have to play.&quot; No! They relish the opportunity. &quot;Let me at
'em,&quot; they say. &quot;I've worked all my life to get here and now I'm
going to prove I'm the best!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's how you should be when the
devil challenges you. You should accept that challenge with joy, knowing you're
going to come out a winner. After all, your God is sufficient to see you
through. He never stops and wonders if He's going to have enough resources to
get you over your problems this time. He knows He can beat anything the devil
brings against you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So, when persecution comes, trust
Him and rejoice, knowing that you've made it to the big leagues now!</p>
