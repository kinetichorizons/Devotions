margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Bible tells us that under
Levitical law, an animal had to be offered every year to atone for the sins of
the people. That word atone means &quot;to cover&quot; and it's used
continually throughout the Old Testament.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But let me tell you something
exciting. It's never used in the New Testament. The Greek word used to describe
what Jesus did for us on the Cross is a different word altogether. It doesn't
just mean &quot;to cover&quot;--it means &quot;to remit; to do completely away
with something.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you know what that means? It
means there is no longer a sin problem. Jesus solved it!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When you made Him your Lord, He
didn't just cover your sins, He put you into right standing with God and
recreated you by the Spirit of God as if sin had never existed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Many believers haven't fully
grasped that magnificent truth. Are you caught up in what I call sin
consciousness? Do you keep thinking of yourself as sin stained instead of blood
washed?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;Well, after all Brother
Copeland, I'm just an old sinner saved by grace.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>No, you're not. You were an old
sinner, but grace changed you forever into the very righteousness of God. You
are now His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus! As far as God is concerned,
your past life is forgotten. It died the death of the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Think about that. Let it sink
into your consciousness until you rise up boldly and receive the freedom from
sin that's yours in Christ Jesus. Receive the righteousness that only the Lamb
of God can give.</p>
