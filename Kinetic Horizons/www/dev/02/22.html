<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>There's just no two ways about
it. To live a life of blessing, we have to make our words agree with what God
says. Not just for a few hours or a few days, but all the time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you've ever done that, you
know it's not easy. As time wears on and the circumstances around you appear to
be stubbornly determined to stay in the same miserable condition, it can be
hard to keep on speaking God's Word. But you have to do it if you ever want
your harvest of blessing to come in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When Kenneth started preaching
prosperity, I sat out there and listened to him with holes in the bottom of my
shoes. But we knew our financial problems didn't change what the Word of God
said. We knew His prosperity promises were true even if we hadn't been able to
tap into them yet. So, even though we felt foolish at times, we just kept on
talking about God's generous provision for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I realized later that Word went
to work for us from the first day we began to believe it and speak it and order
our lives according to it. Our prosperity crop began to grow the moment we
started putting seeds in the ground. It just took time for them to come up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Sometimes, believers don't last
that long. They start planting well enough, but then when they don't see
immediate results, when the bank account gets low and rent is past due, they
get discouraged and begin to speak words of lack and defeat. They tear up their
crop with the words of their own mouth, and they never get to enjoy the fruit
of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The next time you strike out on
faith, whether it's in the financial realm or any other area, keep that in
mind. Determine from the beginning that you're not going to let that waiting
period discourage you. Then hang on until the Word of God is manifested in your
life. Put patience to work and keep your words in line. You will receive your
harvest.</p>
