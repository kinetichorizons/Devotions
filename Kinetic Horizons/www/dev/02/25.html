<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:23.85pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;

<h1>The Choice Is Yours<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%'>Choose you this day whom ye will serve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:12.75pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%'>Joshua 24:15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Choosing to side with God's Word
is a continual challenge. It's not some- thing you do just once. It's a process
of choosing to believe and act upon the Word of God over and over in every
circumstance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's what everyone has to do.
Years ago I decided I was going to choose Jesus. Since then I've had to choose
Him again and again in situations every day. I've chosen Him as my Lord and
Savior. I've chosen Him as my Healer. I've chosen Him as my Financier. I've
chosen Him as head of my household. I've chosen Him as head of my ministry. And
I still have to choose Him moment by moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Sometimes that choice gets tough,
but God has promised it will never get too tough. In 1 Corinthians 10:13, He
says, &quot;There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man:
but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are
able.&quot; What the Lord is saying is that He will not allow you to be
subjected to a temptation you're unable to overcome. With every temptation,
He'll make a way of escape. He'll ALWAYS make sure you have a choice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The devil doesn't come tempt you
while God is off somewhere else, unaware of what is happening to you. The
Spirit of God is constantly there with you, providing you with the way to
overcome. In other words, God matches even the toughest temptations with the
weapons and power you need to conquer them. He always makes it possible for you
to choose life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So choose to walk in love. Choose
to walk by faith. Choose to live by the Word. Jesus is the Way! Choose Him!</p>
