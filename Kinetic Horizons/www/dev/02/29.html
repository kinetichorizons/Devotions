<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus lived by faith. Did you
know that? Some people don't seem to realize that. They think that because He
was the Son of God, He just floated through life with some mystical,
supernatural power we could never have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But Jesus Himself said that the
Father hadn't left Him alone and that He always did those things that please
His Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus walked by faith - and He
got that faith the same way we get it. &quot;Faith cometh by hearing, and
hearing by the word of God&quot; (Romans 10:17).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>How do you think His mother knew
to tell the leaders of the wedding feast at Cana to do whatever He told them?
(See John 2:1-11) How did she know He could solve the problem of lack?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Bible tells us He had never
done a miracle at that time - a miracle of suspension of the normal course of
nature. Yet He had always lived by faith. He was living by faith when He was
just a young fellow of 12 years old saying, &quot;I have to be about My
Father's business.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Year by year, He kept growing in
faith, just as He grew physically. He wasn't born a faith giant. He had to
develop, just as we do. He said, &quot;As my Father hath taught me, I speak
these things&quot; (John 8:28).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus had to be taught. How was
He taught? By the<a href="http://www.kcm.org/index.php?p=daily_devotional"><span

text-decoration:none'></span></a>through the written Word!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Luke 4:16 says that when Jesus
came to Nazareth, &quot;as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the
sabbath day, and stood up for to read.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus was a Bible reader! That
was His custom. He studied. He meditated. He continued in the Word of God. He
preached the Word of God. He knew the truth and the truth made Him<a

text-decoration:none'>!</span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Now more than ever before, it is
vital that you and I follow in His footsteps. We simply cannot afford to cast
aside our Bibles and go skipping off after signs and wonders. No! Our Father
needs us to grow up in Him. He needs those who will dare to stand on the Word
and develop their faith so that instead of seeking miracles at the hands of
others, they will become the hands that deliver those miracles. That, my
friend, is the greatest thrill of all. And that is the day we're living in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Get in the Word today. Meditate
in it. Then go out and live by faith. Jesus did and you are His disciple.</p>
