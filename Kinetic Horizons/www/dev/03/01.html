<h1>Let God Rub Off on You<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.95pt;

line-height:normal'>For those whom He foreknew--of whom He was aware and loved
beforehand-He also destined from the beginning...to be molded into the image of
His Son [and share inwardly His likeness]. Romans 8:29</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.75pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>As a believer, you're destined to be molded into the image
of Jesus, to grow in spirit until you look just like Him. God's supernatural
power began that process the moment you were born again. You were changed on
the inside instantly. How successful you are in allowing this change to
progress to the outer man is mostly up to you. We grow up spiritually just like
we grow up physically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>What can you do to speed this growing process along?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Spend more time pursuing the things of the Spirit than you
spend pursuing the things of the flesh. Become dedicated to the Word of God and
to fellowship with Him. Be willing to pull aside from the busy things of life
and get alone with Him, so He can guide you, teach you and share His likeness
with you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Have you ever noticed that if you spend time around people
who have strong personalities, you will automatically be affected by them?
You'll find yourself doing the things they do. Their mannerisms will rub off on
you. You can't help it. They just influence you, especially if they are people
you respect and admire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The same thing is true in your relationship with God. If
you spend enough time with Him, He's going to rub off on you! His ways will
become your ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>So make yourself available to Him by praying in the Spirit
and worshiping and loving Him. Hang around His Word and the people who love His
Word and live it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:9.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:131%'>Before you know it, you'll begin to notice
yourself changing. You'll find your character becoming more like His. You'll
begin to think like He does and talk like He does and even act like He does.
His image will begin to shine forth in you! <b>Scripture Reading:</b> 1
Corinthians 3:5-18</p>
