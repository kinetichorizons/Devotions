line-height:99%'>I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but
that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the world, even as
I am not of the world. John 17:15-16</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Being peculiar. That's not
something most of us work to achieve, is it? But, you know, we should.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God has called us to be
peculiar--to stand out from the rest of the world as living proof of His power
and His love (1 Pet. 2:9).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He doesn't, for example, want us
to share the ailments of the world. He doesn't want us to share their sickness
and poverty and failure. He's never wanted that for His people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He gave us a physical
illustration of that during the time the nation of Israel was held captive in
Egypt. Pharaoh had refused to set the Israelites free, so God had allowed a
thick darkness to cover the whole land. The darkness was so dreadful throughout
Egypt that no one moved for three days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;But,&quot; says Exodus
10:23, &quot;all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What a thrilling example of how
God wants us to live. We should be glorifying God by the miraculously
victorious lives we lead. We should constantly have people telling us,
&quot;I've heard how God healed you,&quot; or &quot;I've heard how God prospered
you and saved your children!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So don't hold back. Put the Word
of God to work in your life and dare to receive the rich blessings that belong
to those who believe. Start using the Word to draw boundaries around your life,
to paint spiritual warning signs for the devil. Signs that say:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Off Limits! According to God's
Word, I don't belong to you anymore. My family doesn't belong to you. My health
doesn't belong to you. My money doesn't belong to you. My ministry doesn't
belong to you. I belong to a different kingdom. Now, back off in Jesus' Name!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Does that sound a little
peculiar? Good. That's exactly what God has called you to be!</p>
