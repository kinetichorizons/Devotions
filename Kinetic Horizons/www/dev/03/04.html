the truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>People go to great lengths trying
to wring knowledge from God when all they need to do is go to the Bible. God's
not holding Himself back from anybody. It's His will for every man and woman to
walk in revelation of Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;Well now, Brother
Copeland,&quot; you might say, &quot;God's not going to give all these sinners
out here a revelation.&quot; Really? Why do you think He sends evangelists to
preach to them? Why do you think He sent His Word? To reveal the truth!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So, if you want to know that
truth, just open the Book and read it. All of it...not just the parts that are
in red. Those aren't the only parts Jesus said. He said everything in Genesis.
He said everything in Exodus. He said everything in Numbers. He said everything
in Deuteronomy. He said everything in Leviticus. He said everything in Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John. He said everything in Romans. He said everything in the
Book. He is the Word!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In fact, if you'll read the third
chapter of Galatians, you'll discover that every promise made to Abraham was
for Jesus! It was the promises that brought Him. It was the promises that
enabled Him to heal and deliver people. He didn't minister by some special
power nobody else could have. He based His ministry on the revelations He'd
received through faith in the written Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When the devil came to tempt Him,
He didn't fight him off with a special legion of angels who'd been assigned to
protect Him because He was God's Son. He fought him off with the phrase,
&quot;It is written.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God has equipped you to do the
same. He's given you His written Word, and He's given you His Holy Spirit to
help you understand it. He's more than ready to give you the knowledge you
need. You don't have to wring it out of Him--just open the Book and let the
revelations begin.</p>
