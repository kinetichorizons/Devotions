people, he appointed singers to sing to the Lord and praise Him in their holy
[priestly] garments as they went out before the army, saying, Give thanks to
the Lord, for His mercy and loving-kindness endure forever!</span></p>

line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Praise precedes victory!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You can see a graphic example of
that in 2 Chronicles 20. There, the Bible tells us that a multitude of forces
were marching against Israel. The army of Israel was so outnumbered, they
literally didn't know what to do. So they fasted and prayed until they received
a word from God. &quot;Be not afraid or dismayed at this great multitude; for
the battle is not yours but God's.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you know what they did in
response to that word? They put together a praise choir! That's right. They
appointed singers and praisers and sent them out in front of the army! And when
that choir began to sing, the Word tells us that &quot;the Lord set ambushments
against the men...who had come against Judah, and they were slaughtered.&quot; 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When it was all over, not one
Israelite had fallen--and not one of their enemies had escaped. What's more,
when they came to take the spoil, they found so many cattle, goods, garments
and other precious things, it took them three whole days to haul it all home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Now, that's victory! And it all
began with praise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Are you looking for that kind of
victory today? Then stand up and shout, &quot;Glory!&quot; After all, you're in
the same situation those Israelites were in. You have an army marching against
you, but Jesus has already defeated it. He won that battle for you on
Resurrection Morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>All that's left for you to do is
trust Him and begin to praise. Sound out those praises today. Speak them, sing
them, declare them in the face of your enemy. Once he hears them, he'll know he
doesn't even stand a chance.</p>
