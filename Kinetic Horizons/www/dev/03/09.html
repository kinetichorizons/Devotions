<h1>The Habit of Holiness<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='font-size:10.0pt;margin-bottom:.5pt'>He that hath my commandments, and
keepeth them, he it is that loveth me:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.3pt;
margin-bottom:14.1pt;margin-left:22.75pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:99%'>and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will
love him, and will manifest myself to him. John 14:21</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.75pt;margin-left:6.0pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>There's a dimension of living you
can only experience when you make a decision to please the Father in every
activity of your life. In that dimension, Jesus becomes real to you and
manifests Himself to you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Just after the turn of the
century, God poured out His Spirit and started a revival on Azusa Street. It
was an awesome time, a time when people's entire lives were turned inside out.
Everything else in their world seemed to lose importance. Supernatural things
were happening. God was manifesting Himself in their presence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The people involved in that
revival soon began to be known to the world as &quot;holiness&quot; people.
They got that title because they were so obviously different from everyone
else. They would let go of anything they thought didn't please God. They were
so caught up in the power of the spiritual realm, they lost interest in natural
things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Few believers today even know
what holiness means. Even fewer understand the outpouring of God that comes to
those who dare to step into it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Holiness simply means separated
to God. It's what you do with your life day by day. It's ordering your conduct
according to the Word of God and the prompting of the Spirit. Holiness is the
habit of being one mind with God, of turning away from the ways of the world
and living instead in agreement with Him. Holiness doesn't happen to anyone by
accident. It requires a decision of the will. Make that decision today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Love God with all your heart by
keeping His commandments. He'll show His love to you by manifesting Himself to
you in powerful new ways. He'll pour Himself out on you just like He did on
those believers at Azusa Street and revival will truly begin in you.</p>
