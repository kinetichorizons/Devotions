<h1>A Covenant of Love<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:44.25pt;
margin-bottom:12.95pt;margin-left:48.7pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:99%'>For God so
loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son. John 3:16</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>For God so loved the world that
He gave...and He gave...and He gave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That is the message the Bible
brings us from beginning to end. It sounds simple enough. Yet few of us really
comprehend it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We can understand the idea of a
God of power. We can understand a God who desires to be served. But an Almighty
God who loves us so much that He desires, above all, to give to us? That can be
hard to believe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>For thousands of years, God has
been working to drop the revelation of His love into the hearts of men. He's
made loving promises of blessing and protection. But He's always faced that
same obstacle--human beings who just couldn't bring themselves to believe those
promises were true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The story of Abram is a perfect
example. He wasn't accustomed to the idea of a God who gives. After all, he'd
grown up as a worshiper of the moon, and the moon had certainly never seemed
interested in doing anything for him. Then he encountered El Shaddai, the
greatest Being of all. The one Almighty God. And the first thing this El
Shaddai wanted to do was give to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God's promises so astounded Abram
that he couldn't believe them. &quot;Lord,&quot; he asked, &quot;how can I know
I'm really going to receive these things?&quot; (Gen. 15:8).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you know how God answered him?
By cutting a blood covenant with him. That covenant settled forever any
question Abram could ever have about God's love and loyalty. Once blood had
been shed, he knew God meant what He said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God did the same thing for you.
He cut a blood covenant with you. And He sacrificed His own Son to do it.
Jesus' broken body and shed blood have become the eternal proof of God's love
for you. Through Communion, He's urged you to remember them again and again so
that when your faith in His promises begins to waver, you &quot;might have a
strong consolation&quot; (Heb. 6:18).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:14.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Get a revelation of God's love for you by meditating on the
covenant He's made with you. Get out the bread and the cup. Go before the Lord
with them and take Communion thinking about the body and blood of Jesus that
enables you to be a blood-covenant member of the family of Almighty God. Let them
settle forever the question of God's love for you. You'll never again have to
doubt His promises once you believe in His love.</p>
