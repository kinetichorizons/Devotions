<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.75pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Once you begin to believe it is
God's will to prosper you, you can't help but wonder how He is going to do it.
Is He going to put a check in the mail? Or start floating $20 bills down from
the trees?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>No. He's going to do it by
prospering your soul. He's going to plant the seeds of prosperity in your mind,
will and emotions, and as they grow, they'll produce a great financial
harvest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Go to the book of Genesis and
read the story of Joseph. It's a perfect demonstration of what I'm talking
about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When Joseph was sold as a slave
to the Egyptians, he didn't have a dime to his name. He didn't even have his
freedom. He'd been sold as a slave. But, right in the middle of his slavery,
God gave Joseph such wisdom and ability that he made his owner prosper. As a result,
the man put Joseph in charge of all his possessions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Later, Joseph was put in prison.
There's really not much opportunity for advancement in prison, is there? But
God gave him insight that no other man in Egypt had. That insight landed him a
position on Pharaoh's staff. Not as a slave but as the most honored man in the
entire country next to Pharaoh himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He rode along in a chariot and
people literally bowed down before him. During a worldwide famine, Joseph was
in charge of all the food. Now that's prosperity!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>How did God accomplish all that?
By prospering Joseph's soul. No matter how dismal his situation became, no
matter how impossible his problems, God was able to reveal the spiritual
secrets that would open the door of success for him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's what makes God's method of
prospering so exciting. It works any- where and everywhere. It will work in the
poorest countries on the face of this earth just like it works here in the
United States. And you can be sure that it will work for you!</p>
