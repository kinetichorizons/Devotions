margin-left:-.25pt'>March 14</p>

<h1>Activate the Power<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:2.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:104%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:104%'>Now unto him
that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,
according to the power that worketh in us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.45pt;
margin-bottom:12.25pt;margin-left:2.0pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:104%'>Ephesians 3:20</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As a believer, you have the power
of the Holy Spirit inside you. But that power won't go to work until you put it
to work!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Holy Spirit won't just muscle
in on you. He won't come in and turn down the television set and jerk you up
off the couch and say, &quot;Now you listen to me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>No, He's a gentleman. He's sent
to help you to do the will of God, to strengthen you, to counsel you...but He
won't do a thing until He's asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's why the book of James says
if you're in trouble or afflicted, pray. It's prayer that puts the power within
you to work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Just think about that. The Spirit
of Almighty God. The Spirit that hovered over the face of the deep and carried
out God's Word at creation, that same Spirit is inside you--waiting for you to
call on Him!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If Jesus came into your house and
sat down at your table, you'd put aside everything to talk to Him, wouldn't
you? You wouldn't just rush through and say, &quot;Jesus, I'm so glad to see
you. I wish I had the energy to talk to You, but You wouldn't believe what kind
of a day I had today. I mean, everything in the world went wrong and now I'm
just too tired to do anything but lay here and watch TV. Maybe we can spend
some time together later.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You wouldn't do that, would you?
No! If Jesus were sitting there in your room where you could see Him, you'd
fall on your face and begin to worship Him. You wouldn't care how tired you
were or what kind of day you had. You'd jump at the opportunity to fellowship
with Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Holy Ghost is in you. He's
waiting on you. He's ready any time of the day or night. He's saying, &quot;I'm
here to help you and strengthen you. I want to comfort you today. You know that
problem you've been having? I want to help you get that out of your life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Holy Spirit has some things
He wants to show you--things you've been trying to figure out on your own. He's
waiting there with the power to overcome every obstacle in your life. Take time
to pray. Pray in the Spirit. Pray with understanding. Pray and activate the
power that worketh within you today.</p>
