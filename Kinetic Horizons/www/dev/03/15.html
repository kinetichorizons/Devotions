<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Too often we ask God to fix the
problems around us when what He really wants to do is solve the problem within
us. I did that myself for years where my weight was concerned. I prayed and
prayed for God to help me lose weight. Yet I experienced repeated failure. I
lost literally hundreds of pounds, only to gain them right back again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Finally one day, I made a firm
decision. I told God, &quot;I am not going one step further until I find out
what to do about this!&quot; Then I went on a fast, shut myself away from
everyone, and determined to hear from God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>During that fast the Lord
revealed the real source of my problem. He showed me that I wanted to lose
weight, but I didn't want to permanently change my eating habits. I was like an
alcoholic who wants to be able to drink constantly and not be affected by it. I
wanted to eat nine times a day and still weigh 166 pounds!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Suddenly I realized God wasn't
content simply to rid me of the extra pounds on the outside of me--He wanted to
rid me of the sin of gluttony on the inside of me. So I repented of that sin
right then and there. (It was then that I realized just how hard it is for a
man who drinks to face the fact that he's an alcoholic. It hurts to admit
something like that.) Then, instead of asking God for deliverance from my
weight problem, I asked Him for deliverance from my food problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Sure enough, He did it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If your prayers don't seem to be
changing the problems around you, maybe it's time to take a look inside. Maybe
it's time to ask God to go to work on the heart of the matter.</p>
