<h1>Start Planting </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.0pt;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:1.5pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>Being
born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God,
which liveth and abideth for ever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

Peter 1:23</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You won't really get excited
about the Word of God until you realize that it's more than just a collection
of divinely-inspired promises. It's a living force that literally carries
within it the power to make those promises become a reality in your life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Is it tough for you to believe
such a thing is possible?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It shouldn't be. You see it
happen in the natural world all the time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If I were to put a tomato seed in
your hand and tell you that within that tiny, dry seed lies the power to
produce a stalk thousands of times bigger than the seed, to produce leaves and
roots and round, red tomatoes, you wouldn't have any trouble believing that,
would you? You know from experience that even though that scrawny seed doesn't
look like a tomato factory, somehow, given the right environment, it will
become one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus says the Word of God works
by that same principle. There's miraculous power within it. It is a seed that,
once planted by faith in a human heart, will produce more blessings than you
can imagine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Once you grasp that, you'll get
extremely excited about the Word of God. That's what happened to me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Over 20 years ago, I caught a
glimpse of what the Word could do. I caught a glimpse of the power within it.
Before long, I had a Bible in every room of my house, a Bible in my car, and a
tape player going nearly all the time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I spent every possible moment in
the Word of God because I wanted the power of that Word inside me more than I
wanted anything else in the world. I knew it would blow the limits off my life,
limits that had held me back and kept me down for years. I knew that when I
read it, I wasn't just reading, I was planting seeds. Seeds of prosperity,
seeds of health, seeds of protection, and seeds of victory for every area of my
life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't treat the Word of God like
a book. It's not! It's spiritual seed that has the supernatural power within it
to produce the harvest of a lifetime. Get excited about it and start planting
today!</p>
