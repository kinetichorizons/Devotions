<h1>Coming Together<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'></span></h1>

line-height:104%'>Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the
knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the
stature of the fulness of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.35pt;margin-left:2.35pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>Ephesians
4:13</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you know how to listen to the
voice of God, you can hear Him calling throughout the Body of Christ today. He
is calling for unity. He is calling us to lay down our disagreements and come
together in preparation for Jesus' return.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Just the thought of that scares
some believers. &quot;How can I unify with someone from another
denomination?&quot; they say. &quot;I'm not going to give up my doctrines and
agree with theirs just for unity's sake!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What they don't realize is this:
scriptural unity isn't based on doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Winds of doctrine, according to
Ephesians 4:14, are childish. Winds of doctrine don't unify. They divide and
blow people in every direction. The Word doesn't say anything about us coming
into the unity of our doctrines. It says we'll come into the unity of the
faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In the past, we've failed to
understand that and tried to demand doctrinal unity from each other anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;If you don't agree with me
on the issue of tongues,&quot; we've said, &quot;or on the timing of the
rapture...or on the proper depth for baptismal waters, I won't accept you as a
brother in the Lord. I'll break fellowship with you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But that's not God's way of doing
things. He doesn't have a long list of doctrinal demands for us to meet. His
requirements are simple. First John 3:23 tells us what they are: to believe on
the Name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Once you and I come to a place
where we keep those requirements and quit worrying about the rest, we'll be
able to forget our denominational squabbles and come together in the unity of
faith. We'll grow so strong together that the winds of doctrine won't be able
to drive us apart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When that happens, the devil's
going to panic because the unity of the faith of God's people is a staggering
thing. It's the most unlimited, powerful thing on earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Right now all over the world, the
Spirit is calling the Church of the living God to unite. Hear Him and obey, and
you can be a part of one of the most magnificent moves of God this world has
ever seen.</p>
