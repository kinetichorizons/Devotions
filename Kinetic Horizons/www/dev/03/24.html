margin-bottom:13.35pt;margin-left:2.45pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>Proverbs
29:1</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Some people have the mistaken
idea that when the direction of the Holy Spirit comes to them, they can just
ignore it for a while if they want to and then obey Him later in their own good
time. They think to themselves, &quot;I know what I'm doing is wrong. I know my
lifestyle isn't right, but I'm just going to do it a while longer. Then I'll
get things straightened out with the Lord.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Let me warn you, that is an
extremely dangerous thing to do. Because God says that when you refuse His
guidance, your heart grows hard. It's not that God's grace doesn't extend to
you anymore. It's not that He wouldn't forgive you if you turned to Him. It's
just that sin will callous your heart to the point where you can't hear Him
calling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's what happened to the
children of Israel. God would tell them what to do and they wouldn't do it.
When He was trying to bring them into the Promised Land and He told them to go
in and possess it, they flatly refused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Of course, they thought they had
good reasons for refusing. They were so full of fear and unbelief that they
actually thought if they did what God said, they'd be destroyed. But, you know,
it doesn't matter how good your reasons are for disobeying God. That
disobedience will still cost you. It will still harden your heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The children of Israel ignored
God's leading so often that He finally just sent them into the wilderness. They
were so stiff-necked, He couldn't lead them into the blessings He'd planned for
them, and He had to just let them wander around until all but two of them had
died off. He had to raise up a whole new generation of softer hearted people
before He could take them into the land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Take a lesson from that and don't
play around with sin. When God tells you what you need to do, don't put Him off
thinking it will be easier to do it later. It won't be. It will be harder!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When the Spirit of God comes to
correct you, follow His instructions and follow them quickly. Keep your heart
tender. Obey the Lord!</p>
