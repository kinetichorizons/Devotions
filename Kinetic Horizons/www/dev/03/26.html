margin-bottom:12.75pt;margin-left:1.15pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%'>2
Corinthians 5:20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You are an ambassador for Christ!
If you have made Jesus Christ the Lord of your life, you have been sent to act
as a representative for Him in this world. Just as nations send ambassadors to
represent their interests in other countries, you've been sent here to look
after the interests of the kingdom of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Think about that. Everywhere you
go you are representing the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. That's a very
high honor. It may also seem like a rather tall bill to fill. But God has
equipped you to do it. He's given you His Name and the power of His Word. He's
even put His very own Spirit inside you. And He's given you the ability to hear
and obey the directions of that Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I heard a prophecy years ago that
said there would come a time when men on the earth would walk and talk and act
like God. They'd be motivated by His power and His Spirit so strongly that
people would say of them, &quot;Look at those believers. They think they're
God.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; the Holy Spirit said, &quot;they are not God. They
are agents of God, children of God, ambassadors of God, sent to do the works of
God.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I believe we're living in the day
and hour that prophecy was talking about. We're seeing that army of light begin
to grow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>This is no time to be
half-consecrated and half-dedicated. This is the time to go all the way with
God, to give Him your whole life. If you'll do that, He'll give you back such
anointing and such power and such glory and goodness that you'll shine for Him,
as Philippians 2:15 says, as lights in the midst of a crooked and perverse
generation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Begin to think about yourself
today, not as just another ordinary man or woman but as an ambassador of
Almighty God. Let the interests of His kingdom be foremost in your mind and
heart. Submit yourself to Him and say, &quot;Lord, show me how to be Your
representative in everything I do.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You are an ambassador for Christ.
Begin to live like it today.</p>
