line-height:normal'>Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors
through him that loved us. Romans 8:37</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Bible calls us kings and
priests (Rev. 1:6) and world overcomers (1 John 5:4). For many of us, those
phrases are still becoming real. We're still learning who we really are.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you'll look in 1 Chronicles,
chapter 14, you'll see that David had a similar problem. He'd been anointed
king by the prophet Samuel when he was just a teenager. He'd known for years
that someday he'd rule over Israel. Yet somehow, it hadn't really sunk in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But look what happens in verse 2:
&quot;And David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel, for
his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.&quot; Finally,
it dawned on him! David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king. I can
just imagine David saying to himself, &quot;I'm king. I'm actually king! I AM
KING!&quot; At that moment, being king ceased to be something David had only
thought about. It became something he really was. He could see himself king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What does that have to do with
you and me? Much like David, you and I have been given a royal office. But it's
not until we believe it that we can exercise the power or authority that goes
with that office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you're sick, you can yell,
&quot;By His stripes I'm healed,&quot; 50 times a day. You can hope for
healing. You can try to believe for healing till your hair turns gray. But if
you don't really perceive yourself as whole and healthy in Christ Jesus, if you
don't see yourself as &quot;the healed&quot; instead of &quot;the sick,&quot;
you won't get any supernatural help. Yet once that realization hits you that
you are, in fact, &quot;the healed,&quot; no one--not even the devil
himself--will be able to keep you from getting well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:9.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:131%'>Step over the line from trying to believe
to actually knowing by dwelling on the Word of God. Read it and think about it.
Practice seeing yourself through the eyes of the Word until the reality of your
royalty in Christ rises up in you! <b>Scripture Reading:</b> Ephesians 1:3-23</p>
