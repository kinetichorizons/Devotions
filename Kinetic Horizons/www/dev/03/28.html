line-height:103%'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>But God's
free gift is not at all to be compared to the trespass...For if many died
through one man's falling away--his lapse, his offense--much more profusely did
God's grace and the free gift [that comes] through...Jesus Christ, abound and
overflow to and for [the benefit of] many.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:.2in;margin-left:.8pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Romans 5:15</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you ever need someone to tell
you how to turn things around, go to God. He's an expert on the subject. He's
suffered more losses than anyone who's ever lived.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.05pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Just think about it. He lost Lucifer, His top-ranked, most
anointed angel. And He lost at least a third of His other angels as well when
Lucifer fell. Then He lost the man and woman He had created; and because He'd
given them dominion</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>over the earth, when He lost
them, He lost it too. Any way you figure it, that's a lot of real estate down
the drain!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Yet, in spite of all that, God is
no loser. He's the greatest winner of all time. Do you know why? Because He
knows how to turn the losses around. He knows how to use the law of giving and
receiving to transform losses into gains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;Give, and it shall be given
unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running
over&quot; (Luke 6:38).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Isn't that staggering? He had
every option that exists to choose from to redeem the things He'd lost. He had
all wisdom and all power available to Him. Out of all that, the law of giving
is what He chose to use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He gave the most irreplaceable thing
He had: His only Son. Then He backed that gift with His own faith. And when the
law of giving and receiving had done its work, the Almighty Father God received
not only His first begotten Son, but millions of other sons as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.95pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:147%'>Don't despair over your losses. Redeem
them the same way God redeemed His. Give and put the most powerful principle in
the universe to work for you. <b>Scripture Reading:</b> John 3:12-21</p>
