<h1>Dig Into Your Covenant<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%'>This cup is the new covenant [ratified and
established] in My blood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:12.85pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%'>1 Corinthians 11:25</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>New Covenant. It's a familiar
phrase to most of us. But do we really know what it means?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If we did, every one of us would
be faith giants. Instead of struggling, &quot;trying&quot; to believe the
promises of God, we'd be like Abraham. &quot;Strong in faith...fully persuaded
that, what God has promised, he is able to perform!&quot; (Rom. 4:20-21).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's the kind of confidence
that welled up in Abraham when God cut the covenant with him. It was an
inferior covenant to ours, made with the blood of animals. Yet it transformed a
doubting Abraham into the very father of faith. Why? Because, Abraham
understood the significance of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He knew that entering into the
Covenant of Blood meant you were totally and forever giving yourself away to
someone else. Once you did it, nothing would ever be exclusively yours again.
All that you were, all that you had or ever would have became the equal
property of your covenant partner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>During the covenant ceremony in
Abraham's day, the partners exchanged coats, each one giving their authority to
the other. They exchanged weapons as a way of saying, &quot;Your enemies are
now my enemies. I'll fight your fights as if they were my own.&quot; They
walked through the blood of slain animals, pronouncing their loyalty to one
another, even to the death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When God made covenant with him,
Abraham knew there was no longer any room for doubt. God had proven how
intensely He desired to be God to him. He'd given him every thing He had and
bound Himself to Abraham in a relationship that could not be dissolved. Abraham
comprehended the gravity of a covenant agreement. It convinced him once and for
all that God's promises could be trusted. It became an anchor to his soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you want to be a faith giant
like Father Abraham? Then dig into the covenant you have with God. Study it in
the Word. Let the Holy Spirit show you what really happened when Jesus became
the sacrifice that ratified your covenant with God. Let Him show you what it
meant when He gave you His Name (John 16:23), His authority (Matt. 28:18-20),
His armor and weapons (Eph. 6:10-17).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Once you realize what Jesus
actually meant when He said, &quot;This is the New Covenant established in My
blood,&quot; your life will never be the same again.</p>
