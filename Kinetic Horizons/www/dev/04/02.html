raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ
Jesus: That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace
in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>All my life people told me the
reason God saved us was so that when we got to Glory, we could spend the rest
of eternity loving Him and worshiping Him. But, you know, that's just not so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It sounds pretty good, but it's
just something somebody made up. God isn't selfish. He's just the opposite.
He's the ultimate giver. The ultimate lover. He doesn't do anything just so He
can get something in return.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Why then did He save us? The Word
of God tells us He did it so that in the ages to come, He could show us the
exceeding riches of His grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Think about that! God is going to
spend eternity showing the riches of His grace to you and me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's why He sent Jesus into the
world. He so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. God gave Jesus
so that He wouldn't be His only son. He sent Jesus so He could have more sons
to love and give to--and He plans to spend the eons of time doing just that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As a believer, you have the most
glorious future ahead of you that anyone could ever ask. But don't wait until
you get to Glory to enjoy it. You can start right now. You've already been
seated in heavenly places!</p>
