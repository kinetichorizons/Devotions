line-height:104%'>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.65pt;margin-left:2.3pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>John
3:3</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Born again. Do you know what
Jesus had in mind when He said those two words to Nicodemus? He was talking
covenant talk. He was telling Nicodemus what it meant to have a covenant with
God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Let me paint the picture I
believe was in Jesus' mind. Imagine a baby, a little baby born of an unwed
mother. No one knows who its daddy is and no one wants to know. He is a child
that nobody wants. He doesn't belong to anyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Now, picture the best kind of
family you can think of. A family that loves God. The man has a good job.
They're blessed financially. They're givers and lovers of people, and they fall
in love with this baby. Before long, they adopt it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What's happened? That baby was
reborn. He got a new set of parents. Through adoption, he has now become an
heir. Why? Not because of anything the baby has done. Those parents didn't say,
&quot;I want you to look at that baby. I'm so impressed with all that child has
done for us. He has certainly earned our love and respect.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>No, it's a baby. It couldn't have
done anything to earn its new life. This man and this woman agreed together out
of the love in their hearts and bestowed grace on that child. Now he has access
to everything they have. When they offer him a bottle, he doesn't knock the
bottle away and say, &quot;I'm so humble and undeserving. Just give me
water.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Of course not. That baby acts
like part of the family--and not just part of the family but the best part of
the family. Because in Jesus' day a covenant or adopted child had the same
birthright as the firstborn son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's what Jesus was talking
about when He said, &quot;You must be born again.&quot; He was talking about
grace. He was talking about a new relationship of favor. A new family. A new
authority. A new power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you feel unworthy to receive
the rich blessings God has for you today, think about that. Meditate on it, so
instead of worrying about and struggling with the needs in your life, you can
just walk boldly into the throne room of your Father and receive help to get
those needs met.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Discover what it really means to
be a blood-bought child of Almighty God with a big brother like Jesus. Discover
what it means to be born again!</p>
