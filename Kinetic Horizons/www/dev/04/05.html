<h1>We Need Each Other </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:72.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-72.5pt;line-height:103%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>That they all may be one; as thou,
Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the
world may believe that thou hast sent me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.95pt;margin-left:.55pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%'>John 17:21</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It's time we, as believers, began
to enter into the oneness Jesus prayed for in John 17:21. It's time we held
onto one another in good times as well as bad. It's time we realized that we
need one another. We do, you know. I need your faith as much as you need mine.
Together, we can face anything and win in Jesus. Let me show you why. In John
3:34, God says Jesus was given the Holy Spirit without measure. He was more
powerful than all the demons of hell and all wicked spirits of all classes,
including Satan himself. He was able to defeat their power combined.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Now consider this. We are His
Body. Each of us has been given the measure of faith according to Romans
12:1-3. That measure is enough to take care of our own personal needs. However,
there is more involved here than just our own personal lives. We have a world to
win! We are the end-time generation. We need all the help we can get. But,
thank God, we can get all the help we need!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>How? By joining together.
Ephesians 4:13 says that when we all come together in the unity of the faith,
we'll have &quot;the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.&quot; In
other words, when the Body of Christ comes together and begins to function as
one, we'll have the Holy Spirit without measure--just like Jesus did! We'll
begin to see ministries functioning in the fullness of their callings. We'll
begin to see manifestations of the Holy Spirit in full measure. We'll see Jesus
in fullness as we've never seen Him before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Then the world will know the Father
sent Him. Step into that oneness today. Start today making a daily effort to make
yourself available to God to pray for others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Start your day by saying, &quot;Holy Spirit, use me to pray
for someone today. I offer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You my measure of faith.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:19.55pt;margin-bottom:
11.85pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:132%'>Once we truly join together in
faith, all the demons of hell won't be able to overcome us. We'll march right
over them in the fullness of the power of Jesus and bring the age to a glorious
close! <b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>Ephesians 4:1-16</b></p>
