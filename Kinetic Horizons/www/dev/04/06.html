of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Isaiah 51:11</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Did you know that as a believer
you've been redeemed from the curse of grief and sorrow by the blood of Jesus
Christ? You don't have to put up with them any more than you have to put up
with sin or sickness or disease. God started teaching me about this personally
several months before my mother went home to be with Him in August 1988. Every
time He'd show me something about it, I'd put it into practice. (You ought to
do that with anything God is teaching you. Start practicing it now, and you can
walk in it when the time comes!)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So, eight and a half months
before my mother left, I began standing against grief and sorrow. I made a
decision to &quot;sorrow not.&quot; Immediately the devil began to attack my
emotions. But I'd say, &quot;No. I won't receive that. I take authority over
these feelings in Jesus' Name. I've given my body as a sacrifice well-pleasing
unto the Lord, and I won't partake of anything but His joy.&quot; Then I'd
start speaking the Word and praising out loud. I went through three rugged days
of resisting until those sorry spirits were gone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What I'm telling you is this:
You're going to have to stand against grief and sorrow. It doesn't belong to
you. It's not from your heavenly Father. You may have to walk the floor all
night long. But instead of worrying and crying, walk the floor and quote the
Word until that heavy spirit leaves and the joy of the Lord comes. Remember who
you are. You're the one who shall obtain gladness and joy. You're the one
sorrow and grief shall flee away from. You are the redeemed!</p>
