<h1>Resurrection Life </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:
103%'>Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came
unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain
others with them. And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. And
they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-3.75pt;
margin-bottom:13.4pt;margin-left:.5pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Luke 24:1-3</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Truly, it's time for us to stop
looking for the living among the dead. It's time for us to stop wandering
around in the cemetery of sin, sickness and failure and to step into
resurrection life! As a resurrected creature, you're no accident going
somewhere to happen. Your life isn't just a loose web of events and
circumstances. God has specific plans for you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Maybe He intends for you to have
the greatest healing ministry of this century. Or perhaps He wants to turn you
into a tremendous preacher. Maybe He has a revelation prepared for you that
will enable you to bless the whole world. But you'll never know what He has in
store for you until you put your attention on Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>That's why the devil works hard to keep you focusing on the
problems of life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's why he tries to keep your
attention turned away from the living Word of God. He doesn't want you to know
you're full of the resurrection life of Jesus. In fact, the prospect of it
terrifies him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Why? Because once you truly
understand that you have the life of God inside you, you'll begin to act just
like Jesus did. You'll lay hands on the sick and they'll recover. You'll cast
out demons. You'll preach the gospel to every creature. In short, you'll be
just what God intended you to be. You'll be the Body of Christ on the earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't let Satan bind you with the
grave clothes of yesterday's sin and defeat. You're not dead anymore. You've
been raised with Jesus. Come out from the tombs and start living resurrection
life!</p>
