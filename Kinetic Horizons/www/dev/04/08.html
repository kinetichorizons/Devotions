<h1>The Right Road </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.85pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:103%'>I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that
I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose
life, that both thou and thy seed may live.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;
margin-bottom:13.45pt;margin-left:.85pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Deuteronomy
30:19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God's going to get you for that!
People have said that kind of thing jokingly for years. They've somehow
believed that God slaps us down with pain and punishment every time we sin. But
that's just not true. There are deadly wages for sin, but God is not the one
who's doling them out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You see, the Bible tells us
there's been a curse in effect for thousands of years. And the devil is the
cause of it, not the Lord God. God gave warning of it in Deuteronomy 30:19.
After describing in detail the blessings that fall upon those who followed God
and the terrible suffering that would befall those who separated themselves
from Him, He said, &quot;I have set before you life and death, blessing and
cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Think of it this way. Curseville
is out there. God warned us about it and urged us not to travel the road that
leads there. But He has promised to give us freedom, and He'll allow us to
choose our own way. If we get on the road to Curseville and don't get off of
it, we're going to wind up there. Is that because God sent us there? No! He
urged us not to go. The vital thing to realize is this: At any point of the
journey whether you're on the road to Curseville or living right in the middle
of it - God will save you from it. He'll take you out of there and deliver you.
He'll deliver you from diseases, addictions, or anything else that's been
holding you captive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.05pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Today if you find yourself on the wrong road and see
destruction ahead, just repent and get on the right road. Just commit your way
to Jesus and He'll deliver you from whatever may be holding you captive. You
can begin by praying, &quot;Lord Jesus, I've chosen the wrong road and right
now I ask You to forgive me. Today I choose life by choosing Your way. Please
deliver me from this bondage and fill me with Your Holy Spirit. Thank You,
Lord!&quot; Remember this: No matter what you've done, God doesn't want to get
you for it, He wants to forgive you of it. He doesn't want to slap you down, He
wants to save you and lift you up. Trust Him and let Him put you on the road of
life today!<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:111%'>      </span></p>
