<h1>Leave the Past Behind </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

line-height:normal'>But this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are
behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before. Philippians 3:13
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Failures and disappointments.
Aches and pains from the past that just won't seem to go away. Most of us know
what it's like to suffer from them but too few of us know just what to do about
them. So we limp along, hoping somehow they'll magically stop hurting. But it
never happens that way. In fact, the passing of time often leaves us in worse
condition--not better. Because, instead of putting those painful failures
behind us, we often dwell on them until they become more real to us than the
promises of God. We focus on them until we become bogged down in depression,
frozen in our tracks by the fear that if we go on, we'll only fail again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I used to get caught in that trap
a lot. Then one day when I was right in the middle of a bout with depression,
the Lord spoke up inside me and said: &quot;Kenneth, your problem is you're
forming your thoughts off the past instead of the future. Don't do that!
Unbelief looks at the past and says, &quot;See, it can't be done.&quot; But
faith looks at the future and says, &quot;It can be done, and according to the
promises of God, it is done!&quot; Then putting past failures behind it
forever, faith steps out and acts like the victory's already been won.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If depression has driven you into
a spiritual nosedive, break out of it by getting your eyes off the past and
onto your future--a future that's been guaranteed by Christ Jesus through the
great and precious promises in His Word. Forget about those failures in the
past! That's what God has done (Heb. 8:12). And if He doesn't remember them any
more, why should you?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.9pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The Bible says God's mercies are new every morning. So if
you'll take God at His Word, you can wake up every morning to a brand-new
world. You can live life totally unhindered by the past. So, do it! Replace
thoughts of yesterday's mistakes with scriptural promises about your future. As
you do that, hope will start taking the place of depression. The spiritual
aches and pains that crippled you for so long will quickly disappear. Instead
of looking behind you and saying, &quot;I can't,&quot; look ahead and say,
&quot;I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me!&quot;</p>
