devil); be firm in faith [against his onset] rooted, established, strong,
immovable, and determined knowing that the same (identical) sufferings are
appointed to your brotherhood (the whole body of Christians) throughout the
world. And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace...will
Himself complete and make you what you ought to be, establish and ground you
securely, and strengthen (and settle) you. 1 Peter 5:9-10</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>No matter how long you've been
living by faith, no matter how much you've learned about it, every once in a
while you may suffer a setback. You may run into some circumstances that just
don't turn out the way you expected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If that happens, remember this:
Those setbacks are just temporary. You may have lost a battle, but you're not
going to lose the war. Just get up and go at it again.</p>

get the victory?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Because there was something you
didn't know! It shouldn't shock you too much that there are things you don't
know about the realm of the spirit. Ken and I have been in the ministry for
over 20 years. We've spent untold hours in the Word. Yet it seems like the more
we learn, the more we realize we don't know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>So, when we get to a situation where we can't seem to get
victory, we have to ask</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God for more wisdom. If you'll
look in 2 Samuel 21, you can see a time when King David had to do that. His
country had been suffering from a famine for three years and David just didn't
understand it, so he inquired of the Lord. The Lord told him the famine had
come because of something Saul had done! Isn't that amazing? Saul had been dead
for years, yet what he'd put in motion in the realm of the spirit was still
affecting his country.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>David could have just given up
when his usual confessions of faith and ways of praying didn't drive out that
famine, but he didn't. He inquired of God for more wisdom. He used his
temporary setback to cause him to seek more knowledge from God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Follow his example! Overcome the
habit of quitting because of temporary setbacks. Refuse to let them knock you
out of the game. After all, this thing's not over till it's over. And the Bible
says when it's all over, you'll have won. So just be steadfast in your faith.
In the end your victory is guaranteed.</p>
