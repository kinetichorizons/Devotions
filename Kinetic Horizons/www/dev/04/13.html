<h1>Leaving the Pain Behind </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:14.05pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:99%'>Love...is not
touchy or fretful or resentful; it takes no account of the evil done to it pays
no attention to a suffered wrong. 1 Corinthians 13:5</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Have you ever tried to forgive
someone and found you simply couldn't do it? You've cried about it and prayed
about it and asked God to help you, but those old feelings of resentment just
failed to go away. Put an end to those kinds of failures in the future by
basing your forgiveness on faith rather than feelings. True forgiveness doesn't
have anything at all to do with how you feel. It's an act of the will. It is
based on obedience to God and on faith in Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That means once you've forgiven a
person, you need to consider him permanently forgiven! When old feelings rise
up within you and Satan tries to convince you that you haven't really forgiven,
resist him. Say, &quot;No, I've already forgiven that person by faith. I refuse
to dwell on those old feelings.&quot; Then, according to 1 John 1:9, believe
that you receive forgiveness and cleansing from the sin of unforgiveness and
from all unrighteousness associated with it including any remembrance of having
been wronged!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Have you ever heard anyone say,
&quot;I may forgive, but I'll never forget!&quot; That's a second-rate kind of
forgiveness that you, as a believer, are never supposed to settle for. You're
to forgive supernaturally &quot;even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven
you&quot; (Eph. 4:32). You're to forgive as God forgives. To release that
person from guilt permanently and unconditionally and to operate as if nothing
bad ever happened between you. You're to purposely forget as well as forgive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As you do that, something
supernatural will happen within you. The pain once caused by that incident will
disappear. The power of God will wash away the effects of it and you'll be able
to leave it behind you once and for all. Don't become an emotional bookkeeper,
keeping careful accounts of the wrongs you have suffered. Learn to forgive and
forget. It will open a whole new world of blessing for you.</p>
