<h1>Use God's MO </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:
103%'>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of
God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-5.25pt;
margin-bottom:13.45pt;margin-left:.5pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Hebrews 11:3</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God uses words to create. He used
His Word to &quot;frame&quot; the worlds. Just look in the first chapter of
Genesis and count how many times you see the phrase, &quot;God said.&quot;
&quot;God said, Let there be light: and there was light.... God said, Let there
be a firmament.... God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered
together.... God said, Let the earth bring forth....&quot; God doesn't do
anything without saying it first. That's His MO, His mode of operation. And, if
you're smart, you'll use that mode of operation too. You'll take His words and
speak them out until they take on form and substance and become a reality in
your life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;Well, Brother Copeland, I
tried that and it didn't work. I said, 'By His stripes I'm healed' four times
and nothing happened.&quot; God started saying that Jesus was coming in the
Garden of Eden. He said it again in Exodus. He said it again in Numbers and
Deuteronomy. He said it in Isaiah and the other prophets. He said it all
through the Old Testament, over and over again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Then after about 4,000 years, the
book of John tells us, &quot;The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.&quot;
So if you've said you're healed four times and nothing's happened, don't worry
about it. Just keep saying it! You might think it's taking a long time to
manifest, but I'll guarantee you, it won't take 4,000 years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you want to operate in God's
power? Then use His MO. Speak out His words and let them frame a life full of
blessing for you!</p>
