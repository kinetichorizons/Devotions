<h1>Take Some New Ground </h1>

line-height:99%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:99%'>Again I say
unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that
they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.
Matthew 18:19</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As believers, you and I are part
of a conquering army, constantly claiming new ground for the kingdom of God.
Right? Well, yes, that's the way it should be. But just about the time the army
tops the hill and is ready to advance, it seems that Satan pulls out his big
gun--DIVISION--and scatters believers in every direction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>How can we strike back against
the strategy of division? By launching an even more powerful attack of our own.
By using one of the most powerful resources given us by the Lord Jesus: the
prayer of agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus said that if any two of us
would agree as touching anything we ask, it shall be done! That statement is so
powerful that people can find it hard to believe. If they did, you'd find
little groups of Christians huddled up in every corner agreeing together in
prayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Find someone to agree with in
prayer this week. Be sure to base what you pray on the Word of God. You may
have differing opinions about everything else, but you can be in agreement
about the Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Also, be sure your agreement is
total--spirit, soul and body. Cast down arguments, theories and imaginations
that are contrary to the Word. Take every thought captive to the obedience of
Christ. Keep a watch over your thoughts and your words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Then get your body in line by
speaking the thing you've agreed on. Act like you've already received the
answer. Don't keep asking but thank God for it. Stay in agreement and take some
new ground for the Lord!</p>
