<h1>Be of Good Cheer </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.85pt;margin-left:.6pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%'>And now I
exhort you to be of good cheer. Acts 27:22</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What do you do when you're in a
really perilous situation?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you're like I used to be, you
cry out to God in desperation. One afternoon when I was squalling to God about something,
He interrupted me and said, &quot;Kenneth, did you know I don't hear the cry of
My children when they cry out in desperation?&quot; &quot;What?&quot; I said.
&quot;I thought you did.&quot; He said, &quot;No, I hear the desperation cry of
a sinner because that's all he can cry about. But once you get born again, son,
you ought to be crying out of faith. I hear the faith cry.&quot; What is a
faith cry? It's calling things that be not as though they were (Rom. 4:17).
It's what the Bible means when it says, &quot;Let the weak say, I am
strong&quot; (Joel 3:10).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Apostle Paul knew how to use
the faith cry. That's why in Acts 27 he exhorted the men on that battered,
sinking ship to &quot;be of good cheer.&quot; He was telling them to start
acting by faith. Can't you imagine what those sailors thought when he said
that? &quot;Listen to that stupid preacher. We're sinking and he says be of
good cheer. We've thrown everything we have overboard and he says be of good
cheer.&quot; You may feel just like those sailors did, right now. You may feel
like your ship's going down. You may feel like crying out in desperation. But
don't do it. Instead, do what Paul said and be of good cheer!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Cry out to God in faith and say,
&quot;Lord, I'm not going to panic. I'm not going to despair. I'm going to be
of good cheer because Your Word says You'll deliver me from this
situation&quot; (Ps. 34:19). Then start being cheerful. It may take more
determination than anything you've ever done before, but God will give you the
strength to do it. He'll give you the power to be cheerful in the middle of the
most ungodly darkness the devil can bring up. Instead of crying out in
desperation, take a faith stand. Sing and rejoice and praise God for your
deliverance. Be of good cheer and you can be sure God will bring you through
the storm just fine!</p>
