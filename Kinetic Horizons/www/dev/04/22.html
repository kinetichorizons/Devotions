<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you know what it's like to
face a problem so big it seems downright irresponsible not to worry about it? There
may not be a thing you can do about it, but you feel like you need to at least
be concerned. After all, somebody needs to! And no one else seems to be
volunteering for the job. I remember one time in particular I felt exactly that
way. I was holding a series of meetings in Ruston, Louisiana. I had just
discovered our budget was $800 short--and in those days, $800 might as well
have been 9 million! The devil was attacking my mind, telling me that no one
cared about me or my ministry, telling me that I was facing this problem
alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But instead of giving in to those
thoughts, I got my Bible and turned to every scripture in the Word of God that
guaranteed me my needs were met. Then I rolled the care of those expenses over
on God. I promised God that with the Holy Spirit as my Helper, I would not
touch that problem with my thought life again. That wasn't an easy promise to
keep. I wanted to worry so badly! I went into the courtyard of the Motel where
I was staying and walked around the swimming pool. Every time I thought about
the problem, I would say out loud, &quot;No, I have rolled the care of that
over on the Lord. I will not think about it. The budget is met.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>After a while, a man drove up in
the driveway and began to honk his horn. I tried to ignore him because I don't
like to be interrupted when I'm praying, but he stuck his head out of the
window and shouted, &quot;Come here!&quot; He said it with such authority that
I obeyed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He said to me, &quot;Brother
Copeland, I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm committed to another obligation and
will be late for the meeting tonight. I was afraid I would miss the
offering.&quot; Then he handed me a check. When I went back to my room and
looked at that check, I found it was for $500. Coupled with the offering in the
service that night, it totaled the exact amount I needed to meet that budget.
Would you like to have people chasing you down to meet your needs? Then next
time you're facing a problem, give it to God. Let Him be the one who's
concerned about it. He's volunteered for the job and you can trust Him to do it
well. After all, He really does care for you.</p>
