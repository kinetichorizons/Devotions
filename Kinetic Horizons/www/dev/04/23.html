<h1>Oppose the Devil </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.25pt;
margin-bottom:11.9pt;margin-left:11.85pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:115%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:115%'>Submit
yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. James
4:7</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you've been crying and asking
God to run the devil out of your life, STOP! The Bible says you're the one
who's supposed to overcome the devil. How? By resisting him. By rebelling
against him when he tells you to do something and doing what God says instead!
When Satan tells you some lie, contradict him with the Word of God. Oppose him.
This verse says when you do that, he'll flee from you. He'll &quot;run as in
terror.&quot; That means everywhere you go, as you walk in faith and oppose the
devil, darkness is pushed back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So start pushing back that
darkness. You can do it! The life of God is within you. Jesus Himself is living
inside you. Everywhere you go, He goes. Every problem that rises up against
you, every evil spirit that tries to influence your life, is coming up against
GOD when he comes up against you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>All you need to do is become
conscious of that. Begin now living your life moment by moment, knowing that
the light of God is in you. The Word of God is in you. The Spirit of God is in
you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:187%'>Live knowing that
Jesus, the Son of God, is in you. Then watch the devil run! <b>Scripture
Reading:</b> <b>Ephesians 6:10-18</b></p>
