<h1>Obedience: No Small Thing </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.3pt;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:1.8pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:103%'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>But he that
hears, and does not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house
upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately
it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.3pt;margin-left:1.8pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Luke 6:49</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you ever have seasons in your
life when it seems like every time you go to church and every time you spend
time in prayer and every time you open the Bible, you receive a revelation from
God? I do. Spiritually, everything will be going great. I'll be higher than a
Georgia pine. Then, suddenly, something starts to happen. I start drying up in
spiritual things. It seems like it doesn't make any difference what I pray or
how much I read the Word, I can't get anywhere spiritually. I'm so dry my spirit's
creaking!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That used to baffle me. I didn't
know what the cause was. I didn't have any sin in my life. I'd taken care of
that. I was still praying. Still meditating. Still acting on and confessing the
Word. But instead of getting results, I was getting nowhere. I'd stand in front
of my mirror and confess faith over and over again and the only thing that
happened was that my voice got tired! If that's ever happened to you, may I
make a suggestion? Backtrack and find the last thing God told you to do that
you didn't do--and do it!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It's probably nothing big. Just a
seemingly small thing. But, believe me, those minor disobediences will dry up
the flow of the Spirit just like the major ones will. Most of us don't realize
that. We'll get on our knees and say, &quot;Oh Lord, I want to go to China for
You. I'll go to Africa. I'll go to Russia.&quot; But when God says, &quot;Go
next door,&quot; we just shrug it off. &quot;I can't do that,&quot; we'll say.
&quot;That guy next door doesn't like me. Besides, I want to be like Brother
Schambach and get a big tent.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you've done something like
that, repent. Then pick up where you left off and do what God directed. And
from now on, remember, no matter how insignificant God's instructions may seem,
obeying them is no small thing! It's those simple acts of obedience that will
make your spiritual house stand...or fall. All the small things combined become
the direction of our lives.</p>
