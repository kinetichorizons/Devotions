<h1>Follow Your Dream </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5pt;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:1.0pt;text-align:center'>And Moses said unto
God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the
children of Israel out of Egypt? And he said, Certainly I will be with thee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:1.0pt;text-align:center'>Exodus 3:11-12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:4.05pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Have you ever had a Holy Spirit
inspired dream, a dream of doing something really great for Jesus? A dream of
being so prosperous, for instance, that you can finance a nationwide revival? A
dream of leading thousands of people to the Lord? At one time or another, you
probably have, but perhaps you backed away from it. Maybe you thought, &quot;Oh
my, I couldn't do that. Satan's kept me defeated for so long I have a poor
self-image.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If so, I have some good news for
you. If you'll believe God, even a poor selfimage won't keep you from success.
Look in the book of Exodus and you'll see a man who proved that. His name was
Moses. Moses didn't have a very good selfimage. He'd made a terrible mistake
early in his career. It was a mistake that drove him into the wilderness and
kept him there for 40 years herding somebody else's sheep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He'd once dreamed of being a
deliverer of God's people, but no more. As far as he was concerned, he was
finished...a failure...a flop! But God didn't think so. In fact, when God came
to Moses in that wilderness, He didn't ask for Moses' credentials. He didn't
mention his shady history. He just told him to go see Pharaoh and tell him to
let God's people go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Moses, however, was still
wrestling with his poor self-image. &quot;Who am I that I should go to
Pharaoh?&quot; he stammered. You know what God said in response? He just said,
&quot;Certainly, I will be with thee.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You see, it didn't matter who
Moses was. What mattered was that the living God was with him. The same thing
is true for you today. You don't need a history of successes behind you to
answer God's call. You don't need a string of spiritual credentials. All you
need is the presence of the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Think about that when the devil
tells you you're a failure, when he says you'll never be able to do what God
has put in your heart to do. Put him in his place. Tell him it doesn't matter
who you are because the living God is with you.  Then dare to follow your
dream!</p>
