<h1>Don't Let the Devil Put One Over on You </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>When he [the devil] speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for
he is a liar, and the father</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-left:.75pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:107%'>of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.15pt;

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-left:.05in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Some people find it difficult to
believe God's promises because they've seen so many things in the natural world
that seem to contradict them. They've seen faithful tithers go broke. They've
seen sick Christians fail to receive their healing. In reality, it would be
more accurate to say that they think they've seen those things. Because, you see,
there's a deceiver at work in the world. A deceiver who's busily doing the same
thing he's been doing ever since the Garden of Eden: tricking mankind into
believing God's Word isn't true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>And, after working on it for
thousands of years, he's a master at it. Think about that the next time he
tries to make things look as though God's Word is not going to work</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>for you, when he makes it look
like all hope is lost. Say, &quot;I don't care about appearances. I believe the
Word and I refuse to doubt it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Let me show you what I mean. Have
you ever seen a magic show where someone crawls inside a box and then is sawn
in half? You can see it with your own two eyes. The guy's feet are sticking out
one end of the box and his head is poking out the other, and the box is plainly
cut in two. Then the magician slides the two halves back together and the
sawed-apart fellow jumps out of the box in one piece.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Now tell me, did you really
believe, even for a moment, that fellow was truly cut in half? Of course not!
You knew that you'd seen a trick, a deception, something that appeared one way
when, in reality, it was a different way altogether. You may not have known how
it was done. You may not have been able to explain it. But you knew a person
couldn't be sawn in half, then put back together, so you refused to believe
your eyes. That's exactly the way you need to be where the Word of God is
concerned. You need to learn to trust it and rely on it to such an extent that
when Satan shows you something in the natural world that appears to contradict
it, you just say, &quot;Well, I saw that, but I'm not going to be gullible
enough to believe it. I'm just going to stick with the Word.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>If you'll do that, the father of lies will never be able to
put one over on you.</p>
