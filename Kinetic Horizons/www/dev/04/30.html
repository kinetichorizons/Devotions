all grace(every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.45pt;margin-left:4.1pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'> 2
Corinthians 9:7-8</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Some people say you need to
&quot;give till it hurts.&quot; Don't you believe it. God doesn't want gifts
given in pain. He wants gifts given in joy! In fact, those are the only kinds
of gifts that please Him. That's why He tacked His promise of abundance onto
His command about cheerful giving. The two are connected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Cheerful, full of faith, even
hilarious, giving--that is the key that unlocks the treasure house of God. Have
you ever seen a group of people give that way? I have. I'll never forget it. I
was at a camp meeting years ago when offering time turned into a spontaneous, supernatural
celebration. Ken was singing &quot;Cast your bread upon the waters,&quot; and
the people were just dancing their way down the aisles to give their money. The
joy in that place was wonderful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Great healings and miracles were
done that night. But what stood out to me above all was how joyously and
hilariously the people brought their offerings to God. The offering wasn't
extracted from them like a dentist extracts teeth. It was brought forth
gladly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The concept of &quot;giving till
it hurts&quot; didn't come from God. He would rather you give $10 with that
kind of joy than $20 grudgingly. In 2 Corinthians 8:11-12, the Apostle Paul
urges the church in Corinth to give with eager willingness. Eager willingness.
That's what God looks for!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you haven't given that way in
the past, make a firm commitment to start. Repent for the times you've given
grudgingly. Then spend some serious time with God and His Word in your prayer
closet, so when you give again, you can give from a willing heart. Put the
&quot;pain&quot; of giving behind. Become a cheerful, joyous, prompt-to-do-it
giver, and believe me, your blessings will abound!</p>
