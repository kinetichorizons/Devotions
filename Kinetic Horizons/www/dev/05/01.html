<h1>Break Through the Wall </h1>

margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:5.8pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:
107%'></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You're running the race set
before you, moving full speed ahead with God's blessing overtaking you at every
step. Then suddenly, wham! You hit the wall. It may be a wall of sickness or
financial, of spiritual failure or family problems. But, regardless of the form
it takes, the effect of &quot;the wall&quot; is always the same. It stops you
cold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The question is, once you hit a
wall like that, what will you do? You'll be tempted to quit, to turn back in
defeat. But don't do it. Because God will enable you to break through that wall
and keep right on going.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I'm not going to tell you it's
easy. The truth is, it's tough. But you have to push on through the tough times
if you're ever going to have a breakthrough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Ask any athlete. He'll tell you
that! Because if he's a winner, he's been there. He's pushed his body to what
seems to be the maximum. His side has hurt. His lungs have ached. He's had
cramps in his legs and thighs. And just when he felt like he couldn't go on,
he's heard some coach yell, &quot;Come on! Move it!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Athletes call that &quot;hitting
the wall.&quot; It's a time when the body says, &quot;That's it. That's all I
can do. I can't go any further. I can't go any faster. I quit.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But the seasoned athlete knows
that &quot;the wall&quot; isn't the end. It's a signal that he's on the verge
of a breakthrough. If he'll toughen up and push himself a little more, he'll
get a second wind. Suddenly, he'll go faster than before. He'll reach a level
of excellence he couldn't have reached any other way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When you feel the worst, when
failure is breathing down your neck, press into the Word as never before. You
may meditate on a particular scripture for days and even weeks sometimes,
trying to get a revelation of it, seemingly without success. Then suddenly,
like the dawn of the morning, light will come pouring in. You'll see the way to
break through. All you have to do is punch one little hole in that wall of
problems, dig one tiny hole in it with your faith and with the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Then keep tearing away at that
hole. Don't quit! And, before long, the forces of God will come bursting
through, demolishing every obstacle in their path!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Once that happens you'll never be
the same again. You'll be hooked. It will only take one breakthrough like that
to make a never-dying, never-quitting champion out of you.</p>
