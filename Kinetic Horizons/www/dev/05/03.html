12:42</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We often praise God for His
faithfulness. We're thankful that we can always count on Him to be there for
us. But we rarely consider the fact that He needs us to be faithful too. It's
true. God needs people He can count on. He needs faithful and wise stewards He
can trust over His household. In this final hour, He needs faithful believers
to team up with, to manifest Himself in the earth more than ever before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;Oh Gloria, God doesn't need
me!&quot; Yes, He does. Ever since the Creation, when He gave man dominion over
the earth, He's needed people to work with Him to get His will done here. You
can see that all through the Bible. When the children of Israel were in bondage
in Egypt and He wanted to lead them out, He teamed up with a man, Moses, to get
the job done. Moses' responsibility was to stretch out his hand in the earth
and command the will of God to be done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Why did He choose Moses? Because
He needed someone who was faithful and would dare to act on His Word. He needed
someone He could count on, and He knew Moses was that kind of man. Psalm 103:7
says, &quot;He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of
Israel.&quot; If Moses hadn't been faithful to know God's ways, the children of
Israel would never have seen God's acts!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God needs you just as He needed
Moses. He needs you to be faithful and alert to spiritual things. He needs you
to be someone He can trust to know His Word and be obedient to it. He needs you
to be a steward who will stretch out his hand like Moses did so that He can
perform signs and wonders before the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Will you be faithful? It's a
decision you have to make. No one can do it for you. Right now, commit yourself
to be that wise and faithful servant. Say in your heart and with your mouth,
&quot;God, You can count on me.&quot;</p>
