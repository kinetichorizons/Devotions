<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God is not full of surprises.
He's not an unpredictable being who likes to keep you guessing. Countless
believers, however, have the idea He is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;You just never know what
God is going to do,&quot; they say. They base that idea on 1 Corinthians 2:9
which says, &quot;Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into
the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love
him.&quot; They interpret that scripture to mean that God is keeping secrets
from his people. But, praise God, He isn't! In fact, verse 10 says He's given
us His Spirit to reveal those secrets to us! He wants us to know everything
that's on His heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Remember: God isn't in the
business of keeping secrets from you. He's in the business of revealing them.
Take time to listen to Him and you'll never have to settle for a life of
uncertainty again.</p>
