line-height:99%'>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives to
all men liberally, and upbraided not; and it shall be given him. James 1:5</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When you're facing a problem, the
very first thing you should ask God for is wisdom. Not money. Not power. Not
even healing. But wisdom. God's wisdom is the key that will unlock every door
in your life. It will turn your every failure into success. So, stop wasting
your prayer power begging God for things you think you need and spend some time
instead listening to what He has to say about your situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you've never tried that
before, practically speaking, here's what you need to do. First: Lay out the
entire problem before the Lord, not because He doesn't know what you're going
through, but because laying it out helps you. It helps you see things from a
more objective point of view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I remember when I used to take my
problems to my father, A. W. Copeland. Somehow, when I was explaining them to
him, they began to look different to me. I'd get a new perspective, and as I
talked, he'd point out areas I hadn't considered yet. Explaining your problems
to God, point by point, will help you accomplish the same thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Second: Listen for the Spirit of
God to advise you. Pay particular attention to what He says through the written
Word. Most likely, the care of your problem has choked the Word of God right
out of your heart (Mark 4:18-19). If so, you need to get the Bible and begin to
put that Word back in again. Then the Holy Spirit will begin to speak to you
through it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As you're listening, be sure to
remain teachable. Be ready to accept rebuke if necessary. Be very honest with
God. Look for ways in which you've been wrong and confess them to Him. It's all
right. Those sins won't come as any surprise to Him. He already knows about
them. Confession just gives you the opportunity to get rid of them. Third: Act
on the wisdom God gives you. Let go of your own methods and put His methods
into operation. Be obedient. If you don't, that wonderful wisdom won't do you
any good at all. As you pray today, set aside your own ideas and start seeking
the wisdom of God. It's the only thing that can permanently solve the problems
you've been facing. It's truly the most precious gift God has to give. Seek
wisdom.</p>
