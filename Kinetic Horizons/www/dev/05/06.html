<h1>Put the Word Into Action </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

line-height:99%'>Whosoever hears these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will
liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock. Matthew 7:24</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you want your deeds to be
blessed, if you want to see supernatural results in your life, you'll have to
do more than simply read the Word of God. You'll have to put it into action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Years ago when I realized that
God was the one who had the answers to all my problems, that He was the one who
could supply all my needs, I committed myself to do everything His Word told me
to do. I made a quality decision to step out in faith on every command I saw
there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When I found out, for example,
that God's Word instructed me to tithe, Gloria and I were already trying to
stretch what little money we had further than it could possibly go. We were up
to our necks in debt! We couldn't possibly afford to give away ten percent. But
we did it anyway. We stepped out on faith and kept our commitment to do every
command we saw. Before long we began to see financial increase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Keep on reading and studying the
Bible. Listen to teaching tapes. Go to church and hear the Word preached. But
don't stop there. Go one crucial step further by taking the Word you've heard
and put it into ACTION!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.7pt;
