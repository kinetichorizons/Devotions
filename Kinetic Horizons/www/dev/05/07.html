<h1>The Grace of Giving </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:.05pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'>Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and
utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see
that ye abound in this grace also. 2 Corinthians 8:7</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>How do you give to the Lord?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you just drop some money in
the plate at church without much thought? Or do you just write a check to God
at the first of every month and pay Him like you pay all your other bills? You
need to think about that because how you give is a matter of deep concern to
God. He's particular about how offerings are given.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He won't receive just any old
thing however you feel like giving it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In Malachi, for example, God
refused to receive Israel's offerings. They were bringing Him their defective
animals, their blind calves, and the injured ones they couldn't do anything
else with--and God said it offended Him. He told them, &quot;You don't have any
reverence or honor for Me, and I'm not going to accept your offering.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That kind of thing didn't die out
after the book of Malachi. Many today don't have any reverence for God at
offering time. People wait for the preacher to beat them over the head until
they feel so guilty they have to reach down in their pocketbooks and get some
money out. But I want you to know, that's offensive to God. In fact, He spoke
directly to a friend of mine about it. The statement He made to her so
impressed me, I wrote it down word for word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;It grieves Me when the
Church takes offerings,&quot; He told her. &quot;I said to worship Me. Don't
take from the people, but let them bring their gifts and worship Me. Then they
will see the fruits of their giving.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.15pt;margin-bottom:
.25pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>If you and I want God to be pleased with our
offerings, we're going to have to do what the Apostle Paul wrote about in 2
Corinthians 8:7. We're going to have to learn to &quot;excel in this grace of
giving.&quot; We're going to have to quit being casual about it and to learn to
give with faith and reverence in worship.  Next time the offering plate is
passed, don't just drop your gift carelessly in the plate. Get serious.
Determine to obey God. Worship Him with your money and be thankful. He'll do
more than simply receive it, He'll open the windows of blessing for you.</p>
