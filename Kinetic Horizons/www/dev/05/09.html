<h1>The Father's Heart </h1>

15:20 </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>How much love do you have for
sinners?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That may sound like a strange
question, but it's one I want you to think about today. All too often, once we
get saved and get our lives cleaned up a little bit, we lose our compassion for
those who are still lost. We look at the drunk stumbling down the street or the
guy at the office who lies to the boss and tells dirty jokes and turn up our
spiritual noses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But if we ever truly understood
the heart of our heavenly Father, we'd never do that again. Jesus told a story
that can give us a glimpse of that heart. It's the story we call the prodigal
son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You've probably heard it many
times, how the son rebelled and dishonored his father, and how the father, in
spite of it all, received him home with joy when he repented. But there's one
phrase in it I want to draw your attention to today. It's this one: &quot;But
when [the prodigal son] was yet a great way off, his father saw him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That phrase gives such a moving
glimpse of the heart of that loving father. It tells us that even before his
boy had repented, even during those long days when he was up to his eyebrows in
sin, that father was watching for him, longing for him to come home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Every morning he scanned the
horizon, hoping to see the silhouette of his returning son. And the last thing
every night, he'd look again... straining his eyes in hope. His son was constantly
on his mind, and his heart was always full of love for him. The kind of
gut-wrenching love that, on the day his son came home, drove that father to run
to him and kiss him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's the kind of heart our
heavenly Father has for those who are lost. It's the kind of heart He had for
you while you were still wandering in the world. It's the kind of heart that
embraced you with open arms even when you were still covered with the grime of
sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>There's a whole world full of
weary people out there who haven't yet found that embrace. They're more than
just &quot;sinners,&quot; they're our potential brothers...lost ones in
desperate need of a loving heavenly Father. God forbid we should ever turn up
our noses at them. May He help us instead to start bringing them home.</p>
