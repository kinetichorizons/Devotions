<h1>Never Fall </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:7.45pt;line-height:107%'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%'>Study to show thyself approved unto
God, a workman that need not to be ashamed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-left:.3pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:
107%'> 2 Timothy 2:15</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:.85pt;margin-left:3.4pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%'></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.1pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>A lot of people have been playing
games when it comes to the Word. They claim to be faith people in public. But,
in private, they never open the Bible at all. Then, when a time of trouble
comes and they try to stand on the Word, they fall flat on their spiritual
faces. Well, the time for playing games is over. It's time for us to realize
that real faith involves action. James 2:20 says faith without works [or
corresponding action] is dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.1pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>If you want the kind of faith that
will keep you on your feet when others are falling around you, you need to take
some action where the Word is concerned. First, you need to study. You can
study the Word in many ways. You can not only read it, you can dig deeply into
it with concordances, Greek/Hebrew dictionaries and other study guides. What's
more, if you have a cassette player, you can walk around half the day listening
to teaching tapes. It's only one way of study, but it is a powerful one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:34.65pt;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:0in'>The second thing you need to do is go where the Word is being
preached. When Romans 10:17 says &quot;faith comes by hearing,&quot; it's
talking about the preached Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.1pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Whenever I start feeling surrounded by problems and I'm
having trouble hearing from God, I drop everything and find some place where I
can hear the Word preached. I've received more answers from God that way than I
can count. Even though the preacher may not have been preaching about anything
even remotely connected with the issue I was struggling with, some Word of
Scripture would suddenly start my thoughts in a certain direction. I'd realize,
&quot;That's the answer to that problem I've been dealing with for the past six
weeks!&quot;  Third, you need to start confessing the Word you've heard. Find
the promise of God that covers your situation and then declare it out loud as
if it had already come to pass in your life. Get serious about the Word of God.
Study it. Go hear it preached. Confess it. Become such a diligent workman that
the devil himself will look at you with fear and say, &quot;There's one
believer who's not playing games anymore.&quot;</p>
