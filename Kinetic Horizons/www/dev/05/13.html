style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%'>Philippians 3:10</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The more you fellowship with God
around His Word, the more you'll know the &quot;power outflowing from His
resurrection.&quot; You'll develop joy. You'll develop faith. You'll start
developing God's own characteristics... just by fellowshipping with Him. You'll
begin to understand who you really are in Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I remember one day I was reading
the story of the woman with the issue of blood who touched the hem of Jesus'
garment and was healed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I'd read the story many times and
pictured myself as almost everybody in the story...just experiencing how it
would feel to be someone in the crowd or even the one who was healed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Suddenly God spoke to my spirit
and said, &quot;Read that again and this time picture yourself as the one
wearing the garment.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I was stunned. &quot;Lord,&quot;
I said, &quot;how can I do that? I can't take Your place!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;That's just what's wrong
with the Body of Christ,&quot; He told me. &quot;That's the reason the world
doesn't know anything about Jesus. You identify with everyone except Me. But I
sent you to be MY witnesses, to imitate ME, to stand in MY place...not
everybody else's!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So, I read that story again. This
time I pictured myself in the role of the one with the anointing of the Holy
Ghost. Instead of crawling up to touch the hem of His garment, I was the one
wearing the garment, freely giving what God had given me. After all, the Bible
does say, &quot;Clothe yourself with the Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Did you know who scares the devil
most of all? Believers who've found out they can do that. Believers who,
instead of begging for a little touch from Jesus, are letting His very life
flow out to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Come on, give the devil a scare.
Fellowship with your Father around the Word and start discovering who you
really are today.</p>
