<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It's easy to be so afraid of
making a mistake that you never get around to stepping out on faith. You can
spend all your time wondering, &quot;Is this faith? Or is it presumption? What
if I exercise my faith for something and find out later I've missed God's
will?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't worry. God can handle any
mistake you can make. I know because I've made plenty of them. When I did, I'd
just go to the Lord and He'd tell me, &quot;Stay on the Word, son. Together
we'll overcome this thing.&quot; And we always did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you act on the Word out of the
sincerity of your heart and you steadfastly stay with the Word, Jesus will
never let you down...no matter how many dumb mistakes you make. He proved that
the night Peter jumped out of the boat in the middle of the lake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Have you ever stopped to think
about that incident? Peter hadn't been praying or seeking God's will before he
did that. On impulse he just blurted out, &quot;Lord, if it's You bid me
come.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What was Jesus supposed to say?
He couldn't very well say, &quot;It's not Me.&quot; I suppose He could have
said, &quot;Wait a minute now. You don't have the faith to get out here. You'd
better stay in that boat or you're going to drown for sure.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But He didn't say that to
Peter--and He won't say it to you. If you want to get out and walk by faith,
He'll get out there with you and pick you up when you start sinking. He'll walk
you back to the boat if He has to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It's better to risk being
presumptuous than to waste your life in the boat of unbelief! If you have to,
just dive into the water and say, &quot;God, help me!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't let fear keep you from
taking that step of faith. Come on, get out of the boat today!</p>
