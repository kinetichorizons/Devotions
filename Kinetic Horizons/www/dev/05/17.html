<h1>Walk in the Light You Have </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.4pt;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:3.9pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:103%'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>But continue
thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of
whom thou hast learned them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.45pt;margin-left:3.9pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'> 2 Timothy 3:14</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you're born again and have the
Word of God in your heart, you can live in victory. You may not have all the
answers. There may be a great many spiritual things you don't understand. But
it's not those things that are most likely to destroy you. It's the things you
know to do--but don't--that usually make you fall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Just think about walking at night
down a dark, unfamiliar path in the middle of a jungle. The guide up ahead has
a flashlight to keep you on the right path. But then, you just decide to wander
off into the darkness by yourself. What do you think will happen to you? You'll
probably stumble and fall. Very likely, you'll get hurt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's exactly the same thing
that can happen in your walk with the Lord. He knows what's ahead and He shines
just enough light for you to take one step at a time. You have to continue
walking in that light in order to get where you're going.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You may not know why He's leading
you a certain way. You may not understand all the things involved. But God will
make up for your ignorance by the Holy Spirit. He'll see to it that you have
victory if you continue in what you know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.4pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>It's good to keep studying. It's good to keep learning.
But, remember, it's not the great revelation you haven't yet had that will
cause you the most trouble. It's failing to walk in the ones God has already
given you. So be faithful in those things. Continue in them day after day after
day. You'll make it through just fine! <b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>2 Peter
1:2-11</b></p>
