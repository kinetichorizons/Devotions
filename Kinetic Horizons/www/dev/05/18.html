<h1>He'll Be Listening </h1>

ask any thing according to his will, he hears us: And if we know that he hear
us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

John 5:14-15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Have you ever been in prayer and
suddenly had the disturbing sensation that God simply isn't listening? It's
happened to all of us. We limp along praying the same old prayers, half-hoping
those prayers are heard and half-suspecting they're not. Today I want to show
you how to resolve that dilemma once and for all. But let me warn you, I'm not
going to slap you on the back and assure you God will listen to any old
doubtful, self-centered thing you say to Him. He won't.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He's only promised to listen to
prayers that are prayed according to His will. The Apostle John says when you
pray like that, you'll know that you have the petitions you desire of Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The word petition is defined as
&quot;a formal written request addressed to a sovereign superior of a
particular right or grace,&quot; and that's exactly what you need when you're
praying about something serious. How do you put together a solid petition, one
that's in line with the will of God? First, you have to roll up your sleeves
and dig into the written Word. Find scriptures that apply to your situation and
make those the foundation for your petition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Then get on your knees and
consult with the Holy Spirit. Let Him help you develop your petition in detail.
The best way to do that is to spend time praying in other tongues. (See Romans
8:26-27.) Expect God to reveal things from His heart to yours. He wants you to
know His will. So, while you're praying, listen!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Last of all, write it down. Make
a formal written request by writing down every scripture you found. Also, as
you're listening to the Holy Spirit for the details, write down the impressions
and ideas He gives you. Take your time. Let the Spirit develop your prayer. Let
the truth He reveals to you settle in and begin to work in you. Get your petition
firmly in mind, then when you're ready, present it to God. Believe me, He'll be
listening.       </p>
