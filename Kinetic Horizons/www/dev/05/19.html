<h1>Don't Waste Time Wondering </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

line-height:105%'>Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will
of the Lord is. Ephesians 5:17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Sometimes, believers wring their
hands and worry about whether or not they're praying according to God's will.
&quot;Oh, dear me,&quot; they say, &quot;I certainly can't expect God to do
something for me that's outside His will.&quot; And they're absolutely right.
But they don't need to waste time standing around looking puzzled. They need to
grab their Bibles and find out what the will of God is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God has made some very specific
promises in His Word and it's His will to fulfill every one of them in your
life. In fact, those promises are divinely guaranteed by a contract that's been
signed in the blood of Jesus. Think of it this way. Your Bible is the last will
and testament of Jesus Christ. It is a record of your inheritance. Everything
that belongs to you has been written down in that book and the smartest thing
you can do is to find out what is in it. Don't leave it lying on the coffee
table and hit the floor crying, &quot;Oh, God! Oh, God! I'm searching for the
truth.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Pick up your Bible from the
coffee table and find out what belongs to you! Find out how you need to change
to get in line with God's will. Some people don't do that. They try to change
God instead. They'll go on and on trying to convince God just how badly they
hurt or how poor they are. They'll beg and plead and wheedle, all the while
acting as though they had to somehow change God's mind about the situation.
Those folks are in for a long wait.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>God is never going to change. The Bible says He's the same
yesterday, today, and forever. His will is too. So don't waste your time
wondering if your prayers are in line with it. Get the Book and base your
prayers on it. Then you can rest assured the answer is on the way!</p>
