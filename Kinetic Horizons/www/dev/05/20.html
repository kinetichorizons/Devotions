<h1>Free From the Curse </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

line-height:99%'>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made
a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree.
Galatians 3:13</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You know the story. Satan came to
Adam's wife in the form of a serpent and deceived her into disobeying God.
Adam, although he was not deceived, followed suit. When Satan came into the
Garden that day, he didn't have any power at all. He had to come in like a
sneak, not even talking to Adam directly but talking to his wife.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Now Adam was standing there, and
he should have kicked him out right then. But he didn't. Instead, he set aside
the command God had given him and did what Satan told him to do instead...and
when he did that, he made Satan his lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In bowing his knee to Satan, Adam
gave Satan the authority that God had given man. He made Satan the illegitimate
ruler of the earth. Immediately things changed. Through one man's trespass,
death passed to all men (Rom. 5:12). The earth and everything in it was
suddenly cursed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;Okay,&quot; you say,
&quot;are we to live under this curse for the rest of our lives? Wasn't there
anything God could do?&quot; He could and He did! He sent Jesus. Through Jesus,
He set us free from the curse (Gal. 3:13). The moment you made Jesus Christ
Lord of your life, you were delivered from the lordship of Satan. You were
redeemed from the curse. I didn't say the curse wasn't out there anymore. It
is! You can see it all around you. But now you have a choice. You have
authority over it in the Name of Jesus, so you can stand against it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God's done everything that love
can do. He sent Jesus to redeem you from the curse. The rest is up to you. Now
you must appropriate what has already been done for you.</p>
