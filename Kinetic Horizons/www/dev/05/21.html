<h1>Possess Your Promised Land </h1>

the land of Canaan; Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land
from before you...and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:1.9pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God has given you a Promised
Land. It's a place flowing with milk and honey, where your every need can be
met. A place where you can keep sin underfoot as you rule and reign with
Christ. A place where no weapon formed against you will prosper. A place where you
are seated with Christ in heavenly places, far above principalities and
powers--far from oppression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As you study the Word of God,
you'll find that's an accurate description of the kind of victory you should be
experiencing in Christ--not in the sweet by-and-by-but right here, right now.
You may say, &quot;Yes, that sounds nice in theory, but I'm dealing with
reality here. The rent is due, and all I see is sickness, oppression and fear.
This doesn't look like much of a Promised Land to me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Are you still letting the devil
live there? He's not just going to pack up and go home, you know, just because
God has promised you victory. You have to kick him out. But don't let that
scare you. God has given you the power to do it. Remember what Jesus said? He
said, &quot;Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions,
and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt
you&quot; (Luke 10:19).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.9pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>What's more, the devil is totally unarmed! Colossians 2:15
says, &quot;[God] disarmed the principalities and powers ranged against us and
made a bold display and public example of them, in triumphing over them
in...[the cross]&quot; (The Amplified Bible). You have absolutely no reason to
cower before the devil. Jesus defeated and disarmed him through His death,
burial and resurrection. The devil can't defeat you unless you let him. All he
can do is make empty threats. But beware! Empty threats can stop you cold if
you believe them. So don't. Believe the Word of God instead. Use the Word and
the Name of Jesus to drive the devil out of every last detail of your life.
Don't let him dwell in your territory. Force him to pack up and go home. Start
possessing your Promised Land!</p>
