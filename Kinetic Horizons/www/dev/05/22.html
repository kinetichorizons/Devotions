<h1>Silence the Critics </h1>

line-height:103%'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>For so is
the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of
foolish men.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.5pt;margin-left:1.85pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>1 Peter 2:15</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I know from personal experience
that when people start to criticize you and persecute you because you live by faith,
your natural human response is to want to strike back. It's easy to want to
start dishing out a little criticism of your own. &quot;Maybe if they get a
taste of their own medicine, they'll shut their mouths,&quot; you think.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But you know what? They won't. Your
words will just add fuel to their fire and they'll criticize you harder and
louder than they did before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>According to the Word of God,
however, there is a way to silence them. Not by arguing with them. Not by
defending yourself. But by keeping quiet and continuing to do the good works
God has called you to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus was highly criticized by
the religious establishment of His day. But He never fought back. Instead, Acts
10:38 says He simply went about doing good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When people start riding you
about living the faith life, be like Jesus and just keep on blessing people.
Keep on praying for folks who are oppressed by the devil and get them
delivered. Keep on laying hands on the sick and get them healed. Keep on doing
what God has called you to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That will aggravate the devil
because his primary purpose is to make you ineffective for the kingdom of God.
He wants you to get wrapped up in the criticism. He wants to distract you, to
get your mind off the job God has given you. He really wants you to quit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't do it! Instead, follow the
instructions in 2 Timothy 3:14 and &quot;continue thou in the things which thou
hast learned and hast been assured of.&quot; Silence the ignorant criticisms of
men by continuing to do good and by continuing to live by faith. And when all
their foolish words have faded away, you'll still be standing strong.</p>
