<h1>Sure to Win in Him </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:
103%'>Wherefore remember, that...at that time ye were without Christ...having
no hope, and without God in the world: But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes
were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-4.1pt;

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'> Ephesians 2:11-13</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Have you ever really thought about
what it truly means to be in Christ Jesus? Have you ever gotten a clear
revelation of that? Once you do, it will</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>revolutionize your life. You see,
it's in Him that we're raised up from our sins. It's in Him that we're made to
sit in heavenly places so that God can show us the exceeding riches of His
grace. It's in Him that we're made the righteousness of God!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you want that revelation to
explode in you, start searching out scriptures that refer to being in Christ.
Watch for the words in Him, with Him, through Him, or in Whom. Mark those and
meditate on them until the truth of them gets down into your spirit man.
They'll give you some powerful ammunition against the attacks of Satan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When he tries to tell you, for
instance, that you're just a sinner and God doesn't want to be bothered with
your problems, you'll know he is lying. You'll be able to answer him boldly and
say, &quot;Thank God, I was a sinner, but now I'm the righteousness of God in
Christ Jesus. I've been raised up to sit with Him in heavenly places. Now I'm
in Him and you can't touch me at all!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Be prepared the next time Satan
comes at you with doubt, unbelief, and condemnation. Be ready to fight back
with the scriptures about who you are in Jesus. You're sure to win once you
truly know you're in Him!</p>
