line-height:103%'>If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy
God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his
commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon
thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth
thee.</p>

15:26</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Has the devil ever tried to put
you under condemnation by telling you that it's contrary to the principles of
faith to use doctors and medicine when you need healing? If so, here are some
encouraging words that I believe will help you put your heart at rest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It is God's will to heal you.
That's the first and most important thing for you to understand. If your faith
is strong and you can believe the Word without wavering (regardless of what
circumstances or symptoms come against you), then you'll be able to receive
that healing by faith alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But that kind of faith takes more
than just hearing a few sermons about healing. It takes a deep personal
revelation of God's healing power. So, if you haven't yet developed that kind
of faith, the doctor is your best friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you're not certain whether
your faith is strong enough or whether you need a doctor's help, follow the
instructions of the Apostle Paul (Col. 3:15) and let peace be your umpire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If fear rises up within you when
you think about doing without medical help, then go to a doctor. And go in
faith! On the other hand, if you have a sure confidence within you that healing
is yours strictly by faith, let your faith do its work and receive your healing
directly. Whether or not you go to the doctor is not the issue. It is what you
do with your faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Either way, you can rejoice
knowing God is working with you, meeting you at the level of your faith. Thank
God for your healing--however it comes!--and do not let Satan put you under
condemnation. It is none of his business!</p>
