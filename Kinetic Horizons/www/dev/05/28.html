<h1>Receive the Man of God </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.05pt;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:2.55pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:103%'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receives whomsoever I
send receives me; and he that receives me receives him that sent me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.55pt;margin-left:2.55pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>John
13:20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I can't tell you how many
born-again, Holy Ghost-filled Christians pick their pastor apart on Saturday
night and then expect him to pray the prayer of faith for them Sunday morning!
They'll constantly make critical comments about the evangelists and preachers
that God has sent to minister to them and then wonder why the rain of the Spirit
has all but dried up in their churches.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Most of those folks would never
dream of criticizing the ministry of Jesus. Yet, according to the Word of God,
that's precisely what they're doing. You see, Jesus said, &quot;He that
receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me.&quot; I know ministers fail
sometimes. I know they make mistakes. Jesus knew they would too. But, even so,
He said, &quot;If you receive them, you receive Me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you think some preacher's
doctrine is wrong, then pray for him. Stop sitting under his ministry if
necessary. But the Scripture says, &quot;Who are you to judge someone else's
servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord
is able to make him stand&quot; (Rom. 14:4, NIV).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The ministers of the gospel are
not your servants, they're God's servants. Whether they're right or whether
they're wrong, love them and respect them if for no other reason than to honor
the One who sent them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Learn to receive the minister of
God that Jesus sends to you with the same respect and the same honor that you
would give Jesus Himself. You'll open the door for great spiritual power to be
released. You'll clear the way for God to meet your needs. The anointing of God
will be released through the man of God to you. Refuse to let criticism hold back
the anointing of the Holy Spirit. Then get ready to be blessed because, I
guarantee, He won't hold out on you.</p>
