Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>2 Corinthians 5:19</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Very few unsaved people today
have ever really heard the good news. Why? Because too many Christians are busy
telling the world God is mad at them. And telling them that they're terrible
and wrong. Some call that good news, but it's not, and it's not what God has
commissioned us to share.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He's given us the &quot;word of
reconciliation&quot;!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He's sent us to tell the news
that God has restored harmony and fellowship between Himself and men. All men.
Not just believers. Not just the people in your church, but everyone!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's right. The worst old
reprobate sinner in the world is every bit as reconciled to God as you are.
Look at Romans 5:10 and you'll see what I mean. It says that &quot;when we were
enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Reconciled. That word is past
tense. God has already restored fellowship between Himself and the world. He
did it when there was not one person on earth except Jesus who believed in the
new birth. He did it when the entire world was lying in sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Through the death and
resurrection of Jesus, God has cleansed and forgiven and restored to Himself
every man, woman and child on the face of this earth. All any of us have to do
now is receive that good news.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's the good word God has
given us. That's the word we need to share with those who are lost. If we'll do
it, I can almost guarantee you, they won't stay lost very long.</p>
