are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up
from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in
newness of life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Romans 6:4</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As a believer, you actually have residing
in you the same new life God gave Jesus when He raised Him from the dead. The
old sinner you once were has died. You've become a new creation on the inside.
You are full of the resurrection life of God! But sin, disobedience and living
a selfish, carnal life will keep that resurrection life from flowing out. Sin
will separate you from the power of God, even though you're born again.
Resurrection life will lay dormant in you if you walk in sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You can't overcome sin by trying
to stop sinning, however. You overcome it by walking after the new life God has
put within you; by spending time in the Word and in prayer. As you do that, the
Spirit of God will strengthen you and enable you to put that sin under your
feet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Remember, though, the Holy Spirit
will not subdue those old fleshly habits of yours on His own. He'll wait on you
to take the initiative. Then He will strengthen you to follow through with your
decision. He will teach you how to walk in the new life that is in you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Take the first step today by
asking for His help. Say, &quot;Lord, I desire to experience the power to live
by this new life every day. By a decision of my heart, I put down the dictates
of sin. I declare myself dead to it. In Jesus' Name, I will spend time in
prayer and in the Word today. As I do, I believe I'll receive a Holy Ghost
refreshing in my life. I believe I'll begin to live out the resurrection power
that You've placed in me!&quot;</p>
