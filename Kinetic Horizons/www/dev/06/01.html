<h1>The Great Escape </h1>

line-height:103%'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Trust in the
Lord with all your heart; and lean not unto your own understanding. In all thy
ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-2.5pt;
margin-bottom:13.3pt;margin-left:.25pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'> Proverbs 3:5-6</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Once you start stepping out in
faith and walking in the Spirit, the devil will see to it that you have ample
opportunity to fall flat on your spiritual face. He'll try to get you into some
jams where there appears to be no way out. But take it from me as one who's
been there, if you'll look to God and trust His wisdom instead of your own,
He'll always show you a way of escape (1 Cor. 10:13). Not only that, but He'll
do it in such a way that He'll get the glory and you'll have the last laugh on
the devil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I remember one particular
Wednesday night in Wichita Falls, Texas, where I was faced with just such a
situation. I was preaching on the reality of the righteousness of God, and the
anointing was really strong. Just as my message reached its climactic moment, a
woman in the audience suddenly burst forth in tongues. I told her to stop three
times, but she only continued to grow louder. By the time she hushed, the
anointing had gone and the message was forgotten. So I looked at that woman
sternly and began to correct her for being out of order. Then a man sitting
next to her spoke up and said, &quot;Brother Copeland, she is stone deaf. She
can't hear a word you're saying.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>At that point, I had no idea what
to do. Not only had my sermon been shattered, but the whole congregation was
mad at me for getting onto that poor deaf woman. (I found out later the man
next to her used her to disrupt services and run preachers out of town. When
the service reached a high point, he'd punch her and tell her it was her turn
to prophesy.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So I just stopped a moment and
got quiet and waited for the Lord to tell me what to do. Sure enough, He told
me. He said, &quot;Call her up and lay hands on her and I'll open her
ears.&quot; Talk about a turnaround! When God healed that woman's ears, He
turned that disaster into one of the most powerfully anointed meetings I'd ever
had. Everybody was blessed! Next time the devil tries to back you into a
corner, get quiet. Ask God to show you the way of escape. He'll bring you out
in victory every time.</p>
