<h1>Free From Fear </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2pt;
margin-bottom:.4pt;margin-left:.7pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:111%'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:111%'>For God hath not given us the spirit
of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.45pt;margin-left:.7pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:111%'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:111%'>2 Timothy 1:7</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What would you think if I told
you that you could live without fear? Would you believe me if I said that
despite what you saw on the news tonight, you could be perfectly at peace?
Impossible? Unrealistic? No! You see, fear isn't just a reaction to external
circumstances. It's a spiritual force. It begins inside a person. And it is
totally destructive. In fact, fear is Satan's primary weapon. He moves in
response to fear, the way God moves in response to faith. He challenges the
promises of God with it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>An excellent example of this is
found in Matthew 14 when Jesus invited Peter to come to Him on the water.
&quot;But when he [Peter] saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning
to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me&quot; (verse 30).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What enabled Peter to walk on the
water? His faith in the Word of Jesus. What caused Peter to sink? He saw the
wind boisterous and he was afraid. It wasn't the wind that defeated him, it was
his fear of it! He looked at his circumstances, gave into the fear, and the
result was defeat. If Peter had kept his focus on Jesus, his faith would never
have wavered. All the blustering and blowing in the world couldn't have drawn
him off course.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Faith is developed by meditating
on God's Word. Fear is developed by meditating on Satan's lies. Such fearful
meditation is called worrying. Don't do it! The Word of God is the sword of the
Spirit. Use it to fight Satan every time he comes against you. Hold up your
shield of faith and quench all of his fiery darts. Speak words of faith and
fear will depart.</p>
