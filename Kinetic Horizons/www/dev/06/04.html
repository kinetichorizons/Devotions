<h1>Strength Made Perfect </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:
103%'>And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is
made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my
infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.05in;
margin-bottom:13.4pt;margin-left:.5pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'> 2 Corinthians 12:9</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When you run into an impossible
situation, a situation you simply don't have the strength or the ability to
handle, are you often tempted to simply give up and accept defeat? Don't!
Instead shout, &quot;Glory!&quot; because the Word says God's strength is about
to be made perfect in you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The word translated
&quot;strength&quot; in this scripture is dunamis. It means &quot;God's
miracle-working power.&quot; Just think about that. When your human strength
ends, God has promised that His miraculous power will bring you through!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you'll look in Acts 14, you
can see that promise in action. The apostle Paul was stoned by a group of Jews,
taken out of the city and left for dead. Paul's human strength had ended. He
was absolutely powerless.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But the disciples gathered around
him and prayed, and the Lord raised him up and he went on his way. In other
words, when Paul didn't have enough human strength to overcome, God's
miracle-working power was sufficient for him. It enabled him to be an overcomer
in spite of his weakness!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So, if you are facing a crisis
today. If you're sick and medicine has failed you. If your finances are out of
control. If your family is falling apart. If bad habits have you hopelessly
bound. If you've done absolutely all you know to do and you still haven't
gotten results. Then rejoice! For when human strength ends, the power of God
excels! Only believe! God's grace is sufficient for you!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.75pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>Acts
14:1-22</b></p>
