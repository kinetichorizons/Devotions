style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:149%'>A thousand shall fall at thy side,
and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. There
shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Naturally speaking, this is a
terrifying world we're living in today. A world that staggers from one disaster
to another. Almost daily we hear about wars, about the dangers of nuclear
weapons and chemical warfare, about oil spills and earthquakes and floods,
about diseases on the rise and crime sweeping through our cities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But in the midst of it all, God
is promising to be a refuge and a fortress to those who will trust and dwell in
Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;But, Gloria,&quot; you
might say, &quot;He made that promise thousands of years ago when things weren't
in as desperate shape as they are today!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That may be so, but you know
what? That promise is right up to date. It was made for our generation. Just
think about it. Back when Psalm 91 was written, man hadn't even invented
weapons that could destroy ten thousand people at once. We're the generation
that did that. So when He said, &quot;No evil will befall you,&quot; He was
including us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>No evil will befall you. My, what
a statement! You need to catch hold of it and believe it today. Believe that
God wants to be God in your life. He wants to be your protection. He wants to
be your security. He wants to be the first Name you call when trouble comes
your way. He wants to be the One that you trust in and look to, to keep you
safe. And if you'll do that, He'll never, never let you down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He can handle all the dangers
that surround you. I don't care how bad they are, He can handle them! He proved
that with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. They were bound and thrown into a

men who threw them in were killed by the heat. Now you can't get in any more
trouble than that. But God brought them through and when they came out, they
didn't even smell like smoke. Hallelujah!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So, no matter how terrifying
things around you seem to get, trust God. He'll always be faithful. He'll never
be out doing something else when you need help. He'll be right there to deliver
you from any problem, any catastrophe, any kind of devastation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Let Him prove in your life what
He proved in the lives of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: No other can deliver
like Him!</p>
