<h1>High Priest of Your Confession </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;
margin-bottom:.1pt;margin-left:1.35pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:149%'><i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:149%'>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers
of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession
[or confession], Christ Jesus.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:10.9pt;margin-left:1.35pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%'><i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%'>Hebrews 3:1</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Very few believers today
understand the mystery of the apostleship and priesthood of Jesus. We think
that an apostle is some kind of super-saint. But &quot;apostle&quot; actually
means &quot;sent one.&quot; So, Jesus has been sent from God to do something
for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He's been sent to serve as our
High Priest. Again, many believers don't have the first idea what a high priest
does. They picture a person walking around in strange clothes performing
religious rituals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In reality, a high priest is much
more than that. He is one who is authorized to administer, to execute, to
implement and to carry into effect. Now, you may wonder what it is that Jesus
is authorized to administer, execute, or carry out on your behalf. Hebrews 3:1
says that Jesus is the High Priest of our confession. He's been sent to put
into effect, to execute, to carry out the words that you say.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But have you been speaking what
you feel, instead of speaking words of faith? If, for example, you're speaking
sickness, what's He going to do with that? He's not High Priest over sickness.
He can't execute that. If you're saying, &quot;I'm so weak, I'm so tired,&quot;
He can't carry that out. The Bible says, &quot;Let the weak say, I am
strong!&quot; The minute you say that, Jesus can administer STRENGTH.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus is not going to administer
sickness or disease or poverty or sin. He's defeated all that. He is High
Priest over deliverance and righteousness and freedom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Consider that. Then as you come
before Jesus, don't speak words of defeat. Speak words He can implement-- words
of victory. That's what He's been ordained by God to bring to pass in your
life.</p>
