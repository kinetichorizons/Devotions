<h1>Put the Rumor to Rest </h1>

line-height:103%'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>And Moses
stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all
the land of Egypt...but all the children of Israel had light in their
dwellings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.45pt;margin-left:1.1pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Exodus 10:22-23</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Years ago Satan started a rumor.
He told a few Christians that they had to live like the world, sharing all the
same misfortune, defeats, poverty and failure with those around them. Well, the
word spread. You may have heard the rumor yourself. But I am telling you right
now that it is a crafty lie. The Word of God says in Psalm 91:10, that evil
can't even come near your house if you are abiding in Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In John 16, Jesus Himself says He
has deprived the world of power to harm you. And Exodus 10:23 says that when
thick darkness surrounded the Egyptians, the children of Israel had light in
their dwellings. By these and other scriptures, you can see that God never
intended you to experience all the junk the world suffers. He's always wanted
His children to live above it, to stand out as light in a dark world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In the Old Testament, God's fame
was established because of the miracles He had worked for His children. That
same thing should be true today with you and me. We should be glorifying God by
the miraculously victorious lives we live. People should be coming up to us and
saying things like, &quot;I've heard how God healed you.&quot; Or, &quot;I've
heard how your children were delivered from drugs.&quot; Or, &quot;God has
really brought you out of a financial crisis.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Can you see now why Satan would
spread a rumor to make you believe you have to suffer with the world instead of
live as victor over it? He doesn't want people running after you asking where
you get your power, your peace, your health and prosperity. But that's exactly
what God wants to happen. So put the Word of God to work and dare to receive
the blessings He has promised to you. Let the light of God's power in your life
put the devil's dark rumors to rest!</p>
