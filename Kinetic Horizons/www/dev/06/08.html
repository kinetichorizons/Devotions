<h1>Addicted to the Word </h1>

line-height:103%'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Ye know the
house of Stephanas...and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of
the saints.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.3pt;margin-left:1.35pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I want you to begin to develop an
addiction today--an addiction to the Word of God. That may sound odd to you,
especially if you don't have much of an interest in the Word right now. But,
believe me, it's possible. I've done it myself and I've seen others do it, time
and again. All you have to do is make a decision to give yourself to it. To
focus your time and attention on it. The more you give yourself to it, the more
your desire for it will grow. Eventually, it will consume your thinking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Surprised? You shouldn't be. That
happens with anything you totally give yourself to. It happens, for example, with
people who give themselves to pornography. As they focus their attention on it,
the spirit behind it moves in on their consciousness and eventually draws them
from mental activity into physical activity. Finally, they come to a place
where they can't be satisfied. They can't get enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That same principle works on the
positive side when you begin to give yourself to God's Word. You can give
yourself to it to the point where it totally consumes your mental and physical
life. The more of it you get, the more you want. The Spirit behind the Word,
the Holy Spirit, will draw you and lead you closer to Jesus than you ever
imagined possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>I've never yet met anybody walking in faith and power who
at sometime hadn't developed that kind of addiction by giving themselves
totally to the Word for an extended time. I don't mean just a few minutes here
and there either. I'm talking about some serious time. So determine to do that.
Determine to become a Word addict. Once you do, you'll never be willing to live
without it again. <b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>Hebrews 4:1-12</b></p>
