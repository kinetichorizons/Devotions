<h1>Grace is Enough </h1>

line-height:103%'>And lest I should be exalted above measure through the
abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the
messenger of Satan to buffet me.</p>

Corinthians 12:7</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The devil has used the
traditional teaching of Paul's thorn in the flesh to talk believers out of the
blessings of God for years, to try to convince us to settle for everything from
sickness to sin--and to do it of our own free will. It is perhaps the most
destructive and the most widely accepted misinterpretation of Scripture that
exists in the Body of Christ today. I've gone into countries to preach to
people who hardly had any knowledge of the Word at all and still I have found
that somehow they'd been taught about Paul's thorn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>And most of them have been taught
wrongly. Tradition says that God gave Paul the thorn in the flesh. What's more,
tradition makes the thorn into some great mystery. But the Scripture doesn't
say that at all! It says that the thorn in the flesh was a messenger of Satan.
Not God-- Satan! The thorn was quite literally just what Paul says it was--a
&quot;messenger sent from Satan.&quot; You see, everywhere Paul went, he
preached the gospel and every time he preached, he destroyed a little more of
Satan's kingdom. So, Satan sent a messenger, an evil spirit, to stop him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When Paul sought the Lord
concerning this thorn (look at 2 Corinthians 12:8-10), God didn't answer Paul
in the negative. God said, &quot;My grace (or, My favor) is enough. It is
sufficient for you. For My strength is made perfect in your weakness (inability
to produce results)&quot; (W.E. Vine's Expository Dictionary).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In other words, when Paul didn't
have enough human strength to overcome, God's miracle-working power was
sufficient for him. It enabled him to be an overcomer in spite of his
weakness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't allow the devil to talk you
out of your victory. Throw tradition aside and dare to believe the Word of God.
Fight the fight of faith, and just like the Apostle Paul, you will see the
salvation of the Lord!</p>
