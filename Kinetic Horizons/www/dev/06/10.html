<h1>Develop the Love </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:
103%'>And what this love consists in is this, that we live and walk in
accordance with and guided by His commandments His orders, ordinances,
precepts, teaching. This is the commandment, as you have heard from the
beginning, that you continue to walk in love guided by it and following it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-5.75pt;
margin-bottom:13.3pt;margin-left:.5pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'> 2 John 1:6</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Quite simply, God says love is
keeping His commandments. That brings love out of the indefinite into something
explicit. But God has done more than define love for you. He's given you instructions
so that you can know how to love as He loves. By giving you His Word, God has
given you His love manual in black and white. All you have to do is follow it
and you'll be walking in love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you've made Jesus Christ the
Lord of your life, you've already taken the first step of obedience. The love
of God has been born within you. But, unless you take steps to develop it, that
love will remain hidden within you. Love works in much the same way as the
force of faith. Like faith, love becomes active through knowledge of the Word. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Become love conscious by
confessing and acting on God's Word today. As you meditate these scriptures,
see yourself living the love life. See yourself walking in accordance with and
guided by the commandments of Jesus. Develop the love He has hidden in you.</p>
