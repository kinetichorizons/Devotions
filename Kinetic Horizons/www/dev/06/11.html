<h1>From Desperation to Devotion </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:16.45pt;

line-height:105%'>Set your affection on things above, not on things on the
earth.  Colossians 3:2</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Things, things, things! A better
job. A bigger house. New clothes for the kids. Tomorrow's luncheon date. A
better television. Get the picture? Many of us have learned to believe God to
prosper us to such a degree that we have too much to keep up with. We end up
spending so much time and energy taking care of the legitimate
&quot;things&quot; of life that we unconsciously give the attention and
affections of our heart over to this natural world instead of to God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When Kenneth and I first heard
about living by faith, we were in desperate circumstances. We were sick and
broke, so it was easy for us to dedicate ourselves to prayer and to the Word.
But as we honored God's Word, He honored and prospered us. We came to the place
where we were no longer desperate. Then came the real test of our faith. Would
we serve God out of our love for Him instead of our desperation?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Well, praise God, we did. But in
the process we found out one thing: It takes a lot more dedication to serve God
when you're prosperous than it takes when you're desperate! There's a constant
temptation to get so caught up in the earthly things that your desire for the
things of God fades into the background.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As the material blessings of God
come your way, remember, God has not trained you in His Word so you can consume
it on your own lusts. He has revealed His Word to you so you can walk in the
Spirit and do the job He's called you to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't let the things of this
world cause you to miss out on the glorious things of the Spirit. Get your
priorities in line with God's Word. Set your mind on things above, and you'll
discover just how heavenly life was really meant to be!</p>
