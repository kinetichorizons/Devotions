<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>How many blessings are you going
to receive from the Word of God? It depends on how many you expect to receive.
When God measures them out to you, He'll be using your measuring stick, not His
own. He always works that way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Two people can hear God's Word about
healing, for example. One will measure it with faith. &quot;Praise God, by His
stripes I was healed!&quot; he'll say. &quot;I believe that with all my heart,
and I'm going to keep on believing it until I receive my healing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The other will measure it with
skepticism. &quot;I don't care what Bible verses he comes up with,&quot; he'll
say. &quot;I just don't trust that preacher. I'll give this healing stuff a
try, but I doubt very much if anything's going to come of it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Both of those people will get
exactly what they expect. God will measure to them just as they measured the
Word. One will get healed...the other won't.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I must warn you though, sometimes
measuring the Word with faith is hard. Years ago, when Gloria first read the
scripture, &quot;Owe no man anything,&quot; it was tempting for her to measure
it as a curse, not a blessing. We were living in a terrible little house at the
time, and she wanted a new one more than just about anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>How were we ever going to buy a
decent house without borrowing? It didn't seem possible. So, to her, it was as
if that scripture had said, &quot;Gloria, you can't have a new house.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But she refused to measure it
that way. She grabbed the devil by the throat and said, &quot;Look here now,
you're not going to cheat me out of my house.&quot; Then she started believing
that somehow God could provide her with a house<a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you want to receive blessings
by the bushel load, start going to the Word with a bushel basket. Put a big
measure of faith in the hand of God. He'll fill it to overflowing and give it
right back to you!</p>
