<h1>Know God's Will<span style='font-size:26.0pt;line-height:107%'></span></h1>

line-height:107%'>Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that
build it. Psalm 127:1</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What a time of monumental
decisions and changes we're living in. If there ever was a day when you and I
must know God's will and purpose for our lives, it's now. In fact, nothing else
is going to work! God is changing and rearranging things, lining them up for
the endtime move of the Spirit. If you're going to keep up, you must know God's
perfect plan for your life--and how to carry it out in His power! How do you do
that? Through prayer. In fact, God has provided us a prayer in His Word that we
can use to receive the wisdom and understanding we need for this critical time.
You'll find it in Colossians 1:9-11:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;For this cause we...do not
cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge
of [God's] will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; That ye might walk
worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and
increasing in the knowledge of God; Strengthened with all might, according to
his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness.&quot; 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In recent months, God has
instructed Gloria and me to pray that prayer for our ministry partners and for
ourselves every day. It's a powerful, Holy Ghost-inspired prayer that will not
only enable you to know what God's will is, but to have the wisdom and
understanding to carry it out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Once we get a glimpse of God's
will for our lives in the Spirit, let's not mess things up by trying to carry
it out in the flesh. Let's not try to build the house ourselves and end up
doing it all in vain. Instead, let the Lord build the house in His power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Pray this prayer that God has
given us. It was written in the New Testament for you. Put your name in it.
It's a prayer you can be sure God will answer. Put it to work in your life
daily and God will fill you with His knowledge and understanding!</p>
