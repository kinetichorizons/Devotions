<h1>Cast Your Cares on Him </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.1pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that
he may exalt you in due time: Casting all your care upon him; for he cares for
you. 1 Peter 5:6</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When I first learned to cast my
cares on the Lord, I was down in south Texas preaching a meeting that nobody
was coming to. I'm telling you, people were staying away from that meeting by
the thousands; and after a service or two with just the preacher, one or two
others and me in attendance, I was starting to sweat it. But the Lord said,
&quot;Cast that care on Me,&quot; so I did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I started walking around grinning
and whistling. I told the devil, &quot;I'm not going to frown or have one
worried thought. I came here to preach and that's what I'm going to do, and
it's God's business whether anyone shows up or not. I couldn't care
less!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I went around so happy I felt
downright foolish. The devil said, &quot;What's the matter with you? Don't you
even have sense enough to worry over something like this?&quot; I suppose
people were saying, &quot;I guess he's too dumb to worry. I think it's because
he's never been to seminary. He can't tell a landslide from a flop.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But I told the Lord, &quot;I have
my care rolled over on You, and if nobody shows up but that one dear old woman,
she's going to be the most preached-up old woman in the state of Texas because
I'm going to preach just the same as if there were a crowd.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I didn't realize then what was
happening, but that carefreeness put me in a noncompromising position with the
devil. He couldn't get to me anymore. He couldn't get me in fear and unbelief
anymore. He couldn't pressure me and get me to compromise because I didn't
care. I'd given all my care to God!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Are you ready to be free of care?
If you are, just make this confession of faith:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.8pt;margin-bottom:11.85pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>I'm a believer. I'm not a doubter. The Word works in me;
and at this moment, I humble myself under the mighty hand of God. I cast all my
care over on Him. From this moment forward, I refuse to worry. Instead, I will
pray. I will use my faith and believe, and He'll exalt me over the problem and
over the devil. For I belong to Jesus and He cares for me! <b>Scripture
Reading:</b> <b>Psalm 55:16-22</b></p>
