<h1>Hang On </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

line-height:99%'>So shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth: it shall
not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it
shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. Isaiah 55:11</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Did you know that the
battleground for the problem you're facing right now is in your mind and on
your lips? If you'll hit the devil with the Word and cast the care of the
situation over on God, you'll win.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Let me warn you though, hanging
onto the Word isn't always easy. The devil knows that if he doesn't steal it
from you, you'll use it to enforce his defeat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So don't be surprised if he sends
an evil spirit to exalt itself against the Word of God. If you're sick, he may
begin to tell you, &quot;You're not healed. You know that healing's not for
today. Even if it were, it wouldn't work for you. It might work for somebody
else but not you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If he starts to tell you that
kind of thing, don't buy it! Don't start worrying around about it and thinking,
&quot;Oh my, I'm afraid I'm not going to get healed. I sure don't feel healed.
Why, I'm probably going to just get worse and worse....&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Remember this: It's the Word that
does the work, not the one holding onto it. It'll work for anybody who'll put
it to work. It'll work for you just like it worked for Jesus when He walked the
earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He told Satan, &quot;It is
written!&quot; No matter what the devil tries to tell you, refuse to let go of
the Word. Tell him what is written concerning your situation. Let the Word
fight its own fight. It'll whip the devil every time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.7pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>Psalm
