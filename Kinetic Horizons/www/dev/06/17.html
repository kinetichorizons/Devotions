be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: In whom the god of this world hath

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Since God doesn't save anyone
against their will, does it really do any good to pray for people who
consciously refuse to receive Jesus as Lord? Yes. Yes! YES! IT DOES! You see,
in spite of the fact that most all unbelievers who have purposely refused to receive
Jesus as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Lord think they've made that
decision of their own free will, the truth is, they haven't. The Word of God
says they've been blinded by Satan. He's blocking their perception of the
truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So their decision hasn't been
freely made at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's important for you to
grasp. Because through the prayer of intercession, you can interfere with the
satanic forces and help take those blinders off! You can also change
circumstances with your prayers and help create situations that will bring them
in contact with the Lord. You're well within your spiritual rights when you do
that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I prayed with a friend of mine
once who'd been praying for his lost brother for years. Jesus said in Matthew
12:29 to first bind the strong man and then enter his house and spoil his
goods. So we said, &quot;You spirit blinding the eyes of ______________, you
stop what you are doing to keep him out of the kingdom of God. In Jesus' Name,
you stop NOW!&quot; Jesus also said in Matthew 9:38, &quot;Pray ye therefore
the Lord of the harvest that he will send forth labourers into his
harvest.&quot; So we prayed, &quot;Lord, send someone to ____________ with the
Word of God. You know who he will listen to. We claim _____________ for the
kingdom of God. We believe we receive his salvation and deliverance. In faith
we praise You for it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>In almost no time at all his brother called him. &quot;What
have you been doing up there?&quot; he asked. &quot;In the past few days,
everybody I've come across has started preaching to me!&quot; Our prayers had
interfered with the forces Satan had been using to blind this man to Jesus and
created the circumstances to bring him into the kingdom. Sure enough, within a
few days, he was born again. Use this same prayer for your loved ones and
believe when you pray and you'll see the same results. Don't sit by and let the
devil take your friends and loved ones without a fight. Pray. Pray! PRAY! Come
against the &quot;god of this world.&quot; Take off the blinders and open their
eyes to the glorious gospel of God.</p>
