<h1>Discover What Grace Can Do </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:7.6pt;line-height:107%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'>And with great power gave the
apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord</span></p>

107%'></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Most of us don't have any idea
what grace really is. Oh, we know some basic facts about it. We know we were
saved by it (Eph. 2:8). But we don't even begin to understand the real power it
can release in our lives now, today!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you want to get a picture of
what grace can really do, look at what happened to the early Christians in Acts
4. They'd been threatened by the religious leaders of Jerusalem and commanded
not to speak or teach any more in Jesus' Name. So, they were praying about the
situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Roughly, what they said was this,
&quot;Now Lord, we've been threatened, but we aren't about to quit preaching
and go hide under some religious rug. Just turn the power up, give us boldness,
and we'll go on.&quot; Do you know what happened as a result of that prayer? Verse
33 tells us, &quot;Great grace was upon them all.&quot; Great grace. Grace so
powerful that when those believers received it, the whole building shook. Grace
so great it enabled the apostles to work &quot;many signs and wonders... among
the people&quot; (Acts 5:12).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That one story alone should be
enough to convince you that grace is not just some</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>abstract spiritual state of mind.
Grace is real. It's powerful. It provides the supernatural power to make things
happen!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.4pt;margin-bottom:.1pt;
margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:
0in;line-height:99%'>Now, do you want to know something really exciting? The
Bible says that same grace that was available to the early Church in Jerusalem
is available to anybody who's ever sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.
Thank God, that means you and I qualify!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:13.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>If the devil's been threatening you lately, follow the
example of those early Christians. Get in prayer and say, &quot;Lord, I don't
care what the devil and his bunch say, I'm not going to back down. I'm going to
keep on talking and living by faith-and I'm going to do it boldly. So just turn
up the power!&quot; I guarantee you, if you're sincere about it, He'll do it;
and you'll begin to discover what grace is really all about.</p>
