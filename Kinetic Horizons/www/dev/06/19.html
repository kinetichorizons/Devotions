<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I remember the first time I went
with the Oral Roberts crusade team to a healing meeting. I was a student and a
member of his aircraft crew. I had been a believer a little over four years and
knew so little about the things of God, especially meetings like these.
However, I was part of the team and eager to learn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I followed the team inside this
huge auditorium. It was filled with sick people. The place smelled, it was so
full of disease. Just walking in there sent chills of fear up my spine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I turned around and headed for
the side door as fast as I could, talking to God under my breath. &quot;Listen,
I don't belong here,&quot; I told Him. &quot;I'm getting on a Greyhound bus and

that airplane home without me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Once I was outside the door, I
started talking louder. Then suddenly, I froze. My feet wouldn't move. I knew
it was God who'd stopped me because, inside, I was still on my way to the bus
station. But outside, I was stuck to the sidewalk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I looked up and hollered,
&quot;Turn me loose!&quot; But I couldn't move.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Desperately, I prayed,
&quot;Please, let me go! I don't have anything for those people.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's when God spoke back to me.
Every cell in me heard it. He said, &quot;I KNOW you don't have anything to
give them. But I DO and that's why I baptized you in My Spirit.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>My feet suddenly turned loose and
I knew I had a choice. One was life and one was death. So I turned around and
went back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I was ready to run. But God
stopped me. He knew HE was in me, and if I'd just stay and stir up what was in
me, miracles would happen--and they did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You have that same
miracle-working God inside of you. And there are people all around you who need
Him. So quit waiting to feel like you have the power to do it and get out
there. Once you do, you'll discover that the power you've been waiting on has
been right there inside you all the time waiting on you!</p>
