<h1>Put First the Word </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'>For skillful and godly Wisdom is the principal thing.... Prize
Wisdom highly and exalt her, and she will exalt and promote you; she will bring
you to honor when you embrace her. Proverbs 4:7-8</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I want to tell you the only real
secret to getting ahead in this world. It's simple. Put the Word of God first
place in your daily life. &quot;Well,&quot; you may be saying, &quot;I've heard
that before. It's no secret.&quot; But when you understand what I mean, it
could be a revelation to you. You see, the Bible is not just a textbook, a
storybook, or a history book. It's a handbook for living. It's the wisdom of
Almighty God written down so that you can apply it to your everyday
circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God says that wisdom is the
&quot;principal thing.&quot; Principal means &quot;first in importance.&quot;
That means the Word of God needs to occupy the place of highest importance in
all of your activities. I know from experience what an impact that can have on
your life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Twenty years ago I decided to
read the gospels and the book of Acts three times in 30 days. It seemed an
impossible task at the time. With two small children and my house turned upside
down from a recent move, I couldn't see how I could possibly spend that much
time reading the Word and still get everything done. But I set myself to put
other things aside and do it anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Surprisingly enough, at the end
of the first day I had accomplished more than I would have under normal
circumstances. And by the end of that 30 days, I'd not only read the gospels
and Acts three times, I'd kept all my housework done, taken care of my
children, and refinished several pieces of furniture to boot! I was amazed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You'll be amazed at what happens
in your life too, if you give God's Word priority. But let me warn you, don't
wait until you think you have the time. Satan will see to it that you never do.
Just do like I did and set other things aside. Invest your time in the Word
first and that investment will soon be paying off in every area of your life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.7pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>Proverbs
3:1-9</b></p>
