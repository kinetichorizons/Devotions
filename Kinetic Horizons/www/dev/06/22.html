<h1>Expect a Harvest </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Give, and it shall be given unto you; good
measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give
into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be
measured to you again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-2.8pt;
margin-bottom:12.15pt;margin-left:.5pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Luke
6:38</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Give and it shall be given unto
you. That statement came straight from the mouth of Jesus. Yet there are a
great many believers who flatly refuse to believe it. In fact, they actually
have the mistaken idea that it's wrong to expect to receive when they give. The
truth is--it's wrong not to!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What would you think about a
farmer who planted seeds, then let his crop rot in the field? You'd think he
was a fool, wouldn't you? And if he did it when others were starving, you'd
think he was criminally irresponsible. Well, it's just as irresponsible to give
financial seeds and ignore the harvest God promised. Especially when that
harvest could help send the gospel to people who are starving to hear it. It's
just as wrong to ignore the key to prosperity that Jesus Himself gave us as it
is to let a wheat crop rot in the field.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God wants us to receive from the
financial seeds that we plant. He wants us to be prepared to require no aid
ourselves and to be &quot;furnished in abundance for every good work and
charitable donation&quot; (2 Cor. 9:8, The Amplified Bible). He wants us to
have plenty--not so we can hoard it selfishly--but so we can give generously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Next time you give, don't be
afraid to expect a harvest! Release your faith for the financial rewards Jesus
promised. Then, when they come, turn right around and plant them again. Keep
the flow of giving and receiving going so the Lord can bless the world through
you!</p>
