<h1>See Yourself Strong </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:105%'>And we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were
in their sight. Numbers 13:33</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>How does the devil see you? Does
he see you as a terrifying and mighty warrior of God...or does he see you as a
wimp he can whip in a minute? The answer to that question depends on you. I
realized that one day as I was studying the children of Israel and their
failure to enter the Promised Land. The key to their failure is found in these
words: &quot;And we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in
theirs.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The reason the Israelites were so
terrified to fight the giants in Canaan wasn't because those giants were so
big. It was because the Israelites saw themselves as so small! It was what they
were in their own sight that defeated them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The same thing is true for you as
a believer. It's what you are in your own sight that will make the difference.
If, in your own sight, you're a weak, powerless Christian, the devil will run
over you three or four times a day or more if he's not busy. But when you begin
to see yourself as God sees you, as a conquering son or daughter of the
Almighty God equipped with the very power of God Himself, the devil will want
to steer clear of you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The devil would rather do
anything than come against somebody who's bold and courageous, because he's a
coward himself. In fact, ever since Jesus came up out of that grave, Satan's
heart has melted within him at the sound of that Name in the mouth of one who
has faith in it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you're not strong in the Lord
in your own sight, you need to change that. You need to get so full of God's
Word and so full of the Holy Ghost that you walk around like a spiritual giant.
Turn the tables on the devil and let him find out what it feels like to be a
grasshopper for a change.</p>
