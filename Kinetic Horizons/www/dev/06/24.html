<h1>Don't Tell It Like It Is </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:153.25pt;text-indent:-154.0pt'>Death and
life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit
thereof. Proverbs 18:21</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:4.6pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Words are serious business. And,
as believers, we need to get serious about learning how to use them. We need to
begin to put them to work for us like God Himself does. The Bible tells us that
He uses words to &quot;call those things which be not as though they were&quot;
(Rom. 4:17). Most of us don't have the faintest idea how to do that. We've
spent our lives &quot;telling it like it is.&quot; We've constantly used our
mouths to report on the sorry state of affairs around us. Thus, the very
thought of calling &quot;things which be not as though they were&quot; seems a
little crazy.  &quot;You mean I'm supposed to say, 'I'm healed' when I'm feeling
sick? I'm supposed to say, 'I'm prosperous' when I'm penniless?&quot; we say.
&quot;That sounds like lying to me.&quot; No, no. There's a vast difference
between lying and speaking by faith. A lie is meant to deceive someone. It's
designed to make someone believe something that's not true. But to speak by
faith is simply to speak words that agree with the Word of God instead of the
circumstances around you. It's speaking from your spirit instead of from your
mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As the Apostle Paul said in 2
Corinthians 4:13, &quot;We have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote, I
have believed, and therefore have I spoken. We too believe, and therefore we
speak&quot; (The Amplified Bible). Now that's important. Read that verse again.
&quot;I have believed, and therefore have I spoken.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>There are some folks who speak
the words, but they don't have the faith to back it up, and as a result, they
fall flat on their spiritual faces. They didn't actually &quot;call things that
be not as though they were.&quot; They called things that be not the way they
wished they were. Those are two very different things. The words may be the
same. But just wishing and hoping won't get the job done. You've got to
&quot;believe.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Begin today bringing both your
tongue and your heart in line with the Word. Stop &quot;telling it like it
is&quot; and start speaking and believing the promises of God. Put the power of
words to work for you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'></p>
