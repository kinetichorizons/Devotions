<h1>Don't Get in a Hurry </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:.05pt;margin-left:.8pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:99%'>And
these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in your heart: And you
shall...talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;
margin-bottom:12.9pt;margin-left:.8pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:99%'>way,
and when you lie down, and when you rise up. ...and they shall be as frontlets
between your eyes. Deuteronomy 6:6-8</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>One of the reasons Gloria and I
have seen the results we have in our lives and in our ministry is because when
we realized what the Word of God would do, we literally immersed ourselves in
it. We turned off the radio and television, we put down the newspaper, and
spent nearly every waking moment of the time available either reading the Word,
listening to tapes on the Word, or thinking about the Word. All that time in
the Word eventually had a powerful effect on us. It began to revolutionize
everything about us. It began to turn failure into success.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>All that didn't happen overnight,
however. It took time. A great many believers don't realize that. They start
out devoting themselves to the Word, but they make the mistake of expecting
instant, miraculous results, and when they don't see them, they get
disappointed and fall away. Don't do that. Be patient. Give the Word time to do
its work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus once said, &quot;Man shall
not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
God&quot; (Matt. 4:4). The Word of God feeds the spirit man just as bread feeds
the body. Food has to be built into your body. The vitamins and minerals it
contains have a cumulative effect on it, don't they? In fact, almost anything
that affects your body instantaneously is considered dangerous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Much the same thing is true with
the Word of God. It has a cumulative effect. Yes, at times God will act instantly
and perform a miracle, but only to get things back on track. What He really
intends is for you to feed on His Word to grow in strength and in faith and to
bear fruit in due season. So don't get in such an allfired hurry. Stay in the
Word. Be patient. The results will come!</p>
