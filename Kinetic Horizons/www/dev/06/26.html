<h1>Take a Stand Against Strife </h1>

style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:107%'>The beginning of strife is as when
water first trickles [from a crack in a dam]; therefore</span></i></p>

style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:107%'>stop contention before it becomes
worse and quarreling breaks out.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:10.4pt;margin-left:5.45pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%'><i><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:107%'>Proverbs 17:14</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Throughout the Scriptures, God
warns us about the danger of strife. Yet, it's still one of the most common
problems among believers. We let it get into our homes, our work places, our
churches...everywhere!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Of course, we don't purposely let
it in. We don't wake up in the morning and say, &quot;I think I'm going to stir
up some major strife today.&quot; We just inadvertently let it slip up on us
one minor irritation at a time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So, I urge you today to take a
big stand against those little opportunities for strife. If you have a tendency
to let things irritate you, decide to overcome that tendency. Arm yourself
against them with the knowledge that this world isn't perfect, that there are
people in it that aren't going to be nice to you. There are people who are
going to stir you up and annoy you on purpose or by accident.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Make up your mind that, by the
power of God, you're not going to let them get your peace. That peace is so
important to your well-being. It will keep your body healthy. It will keep your
relationships healthy. It will put you in a place where God can guide your
steps and save you from some very grave mistakes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you've spent a lifetime
getting your feathers ruffled over every little thing, it may take a while for
you to break that habit. You may have to work at it a moment at a time. But you
can do it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I know. I had to do that where
worrying is concerned. I'd worried for so many years and had come from such a
family of worriers that I did it almost without thinking. When I learned
worrying went contrary to the Word of God, I had to give it up one minute at a
time. With the help of the Holy Spirit, every time a worried thought would come
to me, I would overcome it with the Word of God. And I did that until I broke
that worrying habit for good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You can do the same thing with
strife. Ask the Holy Spirit to help you start to notice and overcome it one
moment at a time. Then, every time you start to get upset about something,
rebuke that strife in the Name of Jesus and resist it. Say right out loud, &quot;I
am walking in the peace of God today.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You'll be surprised how much more
wonderful living can be.</p>
