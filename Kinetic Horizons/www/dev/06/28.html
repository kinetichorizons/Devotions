<h1>Viva la Difference </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:105%'>If one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a
threefold cord is not quickly broken. Ecclesiastes 4:12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>There's power in unity. The devil
knows that. That's why he's continually fighting it. He takes the differences
between us, differences God put there to make us stronger, and tries to use
them as a wedge to drive us apart. Take men and women, for example. He's
deceived us into fighting about which one is superior over the other. But I can
settle that argument right now. Women are superior to men. If you don't believe
that, you boys try having a baby. But then, men are superior to women. If you
don't believe that, you women try having one without us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It's the differences combined
that make us strong! People have even argued about whether God is male or
female. But the Bible itself tells us that. He's both! That's right. In the
Hebrew language, all words have gender. They're either male or female. But the
Hebrew word &quot;Jehovah&quot; is both masculine and feminine. He's as much
female as He is male and as much male as He is female.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Originally, mankind was that way
too. When God first made &quot;man,&quot; he was as much female as he was male.
Then God separated the female part out and made &quot;woman&quot; or, &quot;the
man with the womb.&quot; After that, man and woman had to come together to be
perfectly whole. That's still true today. For example, when He puts together
husband and wife teams, He often puts people together who have major
personality differences. Where one is weak, the other is strong, and vice
versa. So, when they become one, they're more powerful than they ever were
apart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>There was a time when I didn't
understand that. I got aggravated with God for calling me a wife who didn't
care for so many things that I liked. But I finally realized God knew what He
was doing. If He'd given me a woman who was as nuts about flying as I am, we
would have spent the rest of our lives in the clouds. We wouldn't be preaching
the Word. We'd be in some silly airshow flying upside down. &quot;The Copeland
Team!&quot; or something.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you have people in your life
who are irritatingly different from you? Don't let the devil use those
differences to drive you apart. Thank God for them! Let Him teach you how to
appreciate them. Let Him show you just how powerful you can be... together!</p>
