<h1>No More Dying to Do </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.5pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:99%'>But we see
Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death,
crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death
for every man. Hebrews 2:9</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Death. It's not a popular topic--even
among believers. In fact, a great many are just plain scared of it. Oh yes,
they talk about having eternal life. Yet when the devil tries to threaten their
earthly survival with sickness or calamity, they panic. Why? Because they
haven't learned to look at death through God's eyes. Even though their spirit
has been made immortal, they haven't renewed their minds to include that truth.
If they had, when the devil tried to push their panic button, they'd just laugh
and say, &quot;You can't scare me, devil. I've done all the dying I'm ever
going to do!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's true, you know. The Word
of God says that you, as a born-again believer, are never going to see death
(John 8:51). Jesus has been your substitute. He suffered death, so you wouldn't
have to. And when He was raised, Hebrews 2:14-15 says, &quot;He destroyed him
that had the power of death, that is, the devil; And delivered them who through
fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you've made Jesus the Lord of
your life, the only death you'll ever experience is behind you now. It occurred
the instant you received Christ. At that moment, your old self--the one whose
nature was to sin and rebel against God--died. Your body didn't die, but your
spirit man--the real you-- died to Satan and all of his works. You became
&quot;a new creature&quot; (2 Cor. 5:17), immortal and absolutely incapable of
death!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When you're finished with your
work on the earth, you're not going to die. You'll simply shed your earthly
shell and relocate to a far more glorious place. Go to the Word and get God's
perspective on death. Make a study of it. Once the reality of your immortality
begins to dawn on you, the devil will never be able to threaten you with it
again.</p>
