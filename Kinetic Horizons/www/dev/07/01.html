line-height:105%'>Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath
made ruler over his household? Matthew 24:45</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Word tells us that God shows
Himself strong in behalf of those whose hearts are &quot;perfect&quot; toward
Him (2 Chron.16:9). That word &quot;perfect&quot; doesn't mean that we have to
do everything just right and live without making a mistake. Thank God, we don't
have to do that. It means &quot;devoted&quot;--a heart consecrated, dedicated,
loyal and faithful to God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The mistakes we make will not stop
God from working in our lives. Only our lack of faithfulness can do that. Who
is faithful? The one who spends his time doing what God has called him to do.
Or as Jesus put it, the one who takes up his cross and follows Him. The one who
denies his fleshly desires and spends his life on the things God desires him to
do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Maybe God has been urging you to
spend more time in His Word and in prayer or dealing with you about ministering
more to the people around you. He may be calling you to pray for the sick or to
teach the Word. But you're busy, so you glide on with good intentions and tell
God you'll do it later. Well, later is here! Decide today that you are going to
be the faithful and wise servant. Find out what is stealing your time from the
Lord. Serve His interests instead of your own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you want to be a ruler in the
household of God? Do you want Him to show Himself strong for you? Then take up
Jesus' thoughts today. Take up His purposes and His plans. Now is the time to
be faithful!         </p>
