<h1>Be Unreasonably Committed </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:normal'>Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore
get wisdom: and with all your getting get understanding. Exalt her, and she
shall promote you: she shall bring you to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:12.85pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:normal'>honor, when you do embrace her. She shall give to your head
an ornament of grace: crown of glory shall she deliver to you. Proverbs 4:7-9</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you really want to get the
wisdom of God, you'll have to do more than casually read the Scriptures a few
minutes a day. You'll have to feed on them night and day. You'll have to get
rid of the rubbish you've been feeding into your consciousness by reprogramming
your mind with the Word of God. &quot;Oh, Brother Copeland,&quot; you may say,
&quot;that's unreasonable!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Yes it is. But consider this: A
music major in college practices for hours every day. Olympic skaters spend six
to eight hours a day training for their routines. They do it because they're
unreasonably committed to their goals. The same is true for you. If you're going
to achieve the kind of spiritual excellence you're hungry for, you're going to
have to be unreasonably committed to the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That may well mean that you'll
have to carry a tape player around with you everywhere you go. It may mean that
you'll have your razor in one hand and your tape player in the other or a tape
player in one hand and a fork in the other. Do whatever it takes to totally
saturate yourself with the Word of God. I would speak to you no differently if
I were your commanding officer about to send you into combat against the best
trained elite troops of a savage enemy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You are God's frontline assault
force. You have an enemy who is doing his dead level best to destroy you. In
this crucial, all-out, no-holds-barred offensive, Satan will dispatch hell's
choicest personnel to bring you down. If you're going to make it through in
victory, you're going to have to put yourself in training. Be unreasonably
committed. Get wisdom.</p>
