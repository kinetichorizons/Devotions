unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid. Romans 3:3-4</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Faith-filled words. That's what
changes things. They'll move mountains into the sea. They'll turn sickness into
health. They'll turn a sinner into a saint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>They'll also take a sin-ridden
nation and turn it into God's own country. That's right. Then, if we believers
would back up the prayers we've been praying for this nation with words of
faith instead of doubt and discouragement, we'd soon begin to see spiritual
resurrection in the United States.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God promised us that if we, His
people, would humble ourselves and pray and seek His face and turn from our
wicked ways, He would heal our land. And let me tell you, there are prayer
warriors all over this country (I hope you're one of them) who are doing what
that promise requires.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But, even so, you don't hear many
people saying, &quot;This is great! God is healing the land.&quot; You don't
hear people speaking out by faith the promise of God. Instead, you hear them
saying, &quot;Oh my, oh my, did you hear what those terrorists are doing?&quot;
or some other destructive thing they've seen on television.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Listen, we need to stop preaching
what the terrorists are doing and<a

God said He is healing this land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We must start speaking about this
country by faith instead of going around spouting bad news all the time. Of
course, that will sound odd to most people. Some of them may even think we've
slipped a few cogs. But that's nothing new.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Let me tell you something: One
handful of believers who are listening to, trusting in, and speaking out the
good news of God are more powerful than all the devils on earth. One handful of
believers are more powerful than a whole army of unbelieving doomsayers. Their
unbelief will not make the faith of God of no effect!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's why over the last 25
years, Gloria and I have learned to turn a deaf ear to the bad news and just
start praising and thanking God for His deliverance. Every word of praise we
speak releases faith in our heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:18.65pt;margin-bottom:
10.85pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Get determined with Gloria and me right now. Take a
firm stand with us that things are changing in this country. Settle it in your
heart as you pray. Speak it out. Call it forth. God is healing the land! <b>Scripture
Reading:</b> Nehemiah 6:1-16<span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:99%'></span></p>
