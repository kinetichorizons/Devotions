<h1>Up in Smoke </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:normal'>The tongue is a little member, and boasts
great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindles! And the tongue
is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:12.85pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:normal'>tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body,
and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. James
3:5-6</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Words. Use them right and they'll
move mountains. Use them wrong and they can cause your entire life to go up in
smoke. &quot;Now, Brother Copeland,&quot; you may say, &quot;I find it hard to
believe that major catastrophes can be caused by a few simple words. I just
can't see the connection.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Look again at the phrase James
used. &quot;How great a matter a little fire kindles!&quot; Have you ever lit a
few little pieces of kindling wood and set them in the fireplace beneath a
stack of logs? What happened? Most likely, the fire began to spread first to
one log then to another until finally you had a great big blaze going. After it
was over, you couldn't go digging around in the ashes to find the kindling that
started it all, could you? No! It would be burned. There would be no trace of
it at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The tongue is like that. It first
defiles the body, then sets on fire the whole course of nature with a blaze so
great that it leaves no natural trace of its origin. The words that started it
end up so deeply buried in the ashes that you would never even know they were
there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So, don't ever underestimate the
power of your words. I can assure you, Satan doesn't. He works constantly to
get you to turn them in a negative direction. He'll fire darts of pain and
sickness and discouragement at you just to get you to speak faithless
words--words that will eventually send your life up in smoke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't let him succeed. Instead,
put out that fire by following the instructions in Ephesians 6:16. Do as the
Apostle Paul says and &quot;above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye
shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.&quot; Speak words of
faith and stop the fire before it starts today!</p>
