line-height:107%'>The borrower is servant to the lender. Proverbs 22:7</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you're up to your neck in debt
today, I have good news for you. God wants to set you free from those debts and
He has the power to do it. I know. He did it for me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I'll never forget it. I had
$22,000 worth of bad debts at the time. I'd committed to God to pay them off
and never borrow another dime--but it looked to me like I'd never be able to do
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We didn't see how, but we
believed that &quot;God is able.&quot; Day by day we looked to God for our
deliverance from debt. Not asking Him every day, but thanking Him because we
believed we received when we prayed. Eleven months later, we were out of debt.
As we looked back, nothing spectacular had happened, but God worked in our
finances continuously. As we were faithful, He was faithful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God can do the same thing for you
if you'll dare to believe His Word. If you'll make a commitment before Him to
get out from under those debts and then obey Him every step of the way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As you look at your situation
right now, you may not be able to see how you could ever get out of debt, much
less stay that way. I felt that way too, at first. I just didn't see how I'd
ever be able to do much of anything without borrowing money.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But He showed me how--and He'll
do the same thing for you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:16.75pt;margin-bottom:
11.85pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:132%'>There's no debt too big and no
business too complicated for Him to handle. If you'll trust Him to manage
yours, He will bring you out on top...and you'll never have to be a slave to
debt again. <b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>Psalm 37:21-40</b></p>
