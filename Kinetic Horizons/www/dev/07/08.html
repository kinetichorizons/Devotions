line-height:99%'>Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them
that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;
That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven. Matthew 5:44-45</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Love your enemies...turn the
other cheek...to most people that sounds like a pretty weak way to handle
somebody who's causing them trouble. But, the truth is, it's the most powerful
way there is. It's the way Jesus did it-- and His way never fails. Do you remember
when Jesus went back to Nazareth and the religious folks were angry with Him
and wanted to push Him off a cliff? What happened? He just walked right past
them, and no one could lay a finger on Him. Another time they decided to stone
Him, and He didn't retaliate that time either. He just walked off. No one could
touch Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When Jesus walked through that
crowd, He wasn't afraid. He knew they couldn't hurt Him because He was walking
in the love of God. When Jesus said to turn the other cheek, He didn't mean for
you to stand there and have your brains beaten out. He meant for you to stand
there in love and in faith believing that the protecting power of God that
accompanies that love would keep you safe. He meant for a man to swing at you
and not be able to hit you!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The story of Nicky Cruz as
recorded in David Wilkerson's book, The Cross and the Switchblade, is a perfect
example of that. Nicky was reputed to be the most ruthless gang leader of his
time. Yet, when David Wilkerson stood in front of him, telling him about Jesus,
Nicky was totally unable to hurt him. He thrust his knife at David several
times. But every time he did, David just said, &quot;Nicky, you can cut me into
a thousand pieces and every piece will still say, 'I love you and God loves
you.'&quot; Because of love, Nicky couldn't get his knife close enough to David
to hurt him. A supernatural force always stopped it short. &quot;But I don't
have that kind of love!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Yes, you do. Romans 5:5 tells us
that the love of God is shed abroad in your heart by the Holy Spirit. All you
have to do is make the decision to be motivated by that love rather than your
own human feelings. My friend, love never fails! You don't have to be afraid of
failure anymore. In fact, you don't have to be afraid of anything. If you're
walking in the love of God, you're living the most powerful kind of life there
is.</p>
