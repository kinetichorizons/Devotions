<h1>Keep the Weeds Out </h1>

line-height:normal'>So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into
the ground. Mark 4:26</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus compared the kingdom of God
with the planting of seed and reaping the harvest. It's a simple concept. One
all of us understand. Why, then, aren't all of us producing bumper crops every
season? Because we're sitting around waiting for God to do all the work. He
doesn't operate that way. He'll work with you, but He won't do it all. There
are some essential things you must do by faith if you want to have a crop to
reap at harvest time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>First, you must sow the seed of
the Word in faith, expecting it to grow. You must find precious promises from
God in His Word, plant them in your heart and in your life. Next, you must
water the seed. Water it every day with praise. Water it with the spiritual
water of the Word. That Word contains life and those seed promises can't grow
without it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>And finally, you have to keep the
weeds out! When the weeds of unforgiveness, doubt, fear, discouragement, (and
all the other junk the devil tries to sow into your crop) try to enter in, get
rid of them. They'll choke the Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's going to take some
diligence on your part. No one else will do it for you. You're going to have to
weed your own crop yourself. So get tough about it. When a little weed pops up,
kill it! Don't hang on to it for even a moment. Pull it up by its roots. Spray
it with the Word. Don't be tempted to keep a wildflower when you can have the
best--God's best. Don't sit around waiting for God to produce your harvest.
Start planting. Start watching over your land (your heart and your mind) to
keep it moist, watered with the Word, and free from weeds. Commit to do your
part and trust God to do His. You will have a bumper crop this season!</p>
