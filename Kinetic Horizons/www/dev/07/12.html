<h1>Be Skillful </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;

line-height:104%'>The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that
seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.25pt;margin-left:.8pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>Psalm
34:10</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Did you know that, according to
the Word of God, there is no lack in the Body of Christ? Everything we could
ever need, every problem we could ever face has been covered by the blood of
Jesus. His exceeding great and precious promises have supplied it all. Why then
do many of us keep on suffering lack? Because we haven't, as Hebrews 5:13 says,
become skillful in the Word of righteousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It takes skill to apply the Word
of God. Sometimes we just sling the Word around and try to use it any old way.
We pray some ignorant prayer and then say, &quot;Oh well, God knows what I
mean&quot; and expect it to be answered. It's funny though. We'd never stand
for that kind of carelessness in the natural realm. If our doctor came in and
just threw a bottle of pills at us and said, &quot;Here, take that,&quot;
without even trying to find out what's wrong with us, we'd leave his office and
never come back. Yet, we're shocked when that same careless attitude in the
spiritual realm keeps our prayers from being effective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We live in an &quot;instant&quot;
society where everything is quick and easy. And too many of us are letting that
instant mentality leak over into our walk with the Lord Jesus Christ. When
someone needs healing, we bust through the hospital door, dab a little oil
between their eyes and say, &quot;Glory to God!&quot; and out the door we go.
Sometimes it doesn't take any longer than &quot;In the Name of Jesus be healed!&quot;
But sometimes there is something else that must be done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The time has come for us to shake
off that &quot;instant&quot; mentality and realize that there are situations
where we're going to have to take some time and pray in the Holy Ghost. Times
when we're going to have to sit there and listen for God's instructions. If
you've come up short in any area of life--whether it be healing or finances or
anything else--determine to develop your Word skills where that area is
concerned. Get out your Bible. Read through all the healing scriptures. Read
through all the miracle scriptures. Read through all the promises of God. Read
through all the blessings of Abraham. Meditate on them. Ask God to speak to you
through them and to enlighten you about the situation you're facing. Don't just
sling the Word around. Dig into it. Fellowship with your Father over it. Let
Him show you how to apply it skillfully, and eventually, you'll lack no good
thing.</p>
