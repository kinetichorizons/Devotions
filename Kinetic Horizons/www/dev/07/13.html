<h1>Don't Overlook the Blessings </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:105%'>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works
for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. 2 Corinthians 4:17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It's easy to get your spiritual
eyes fixed so firmly on the problems in your life, you overlook the blessings
completely! As a result, you end up suffering through situations that should
have you rejoicing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Let me show you what I mean. Not
long ago, this ministry was facing some terrific financial pressures. I stood
in faith against them. I battled against them with the Word and in prayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What I didn't realize was this:
During that time when the problems seemed so great--the blessings were even
greater. This ministry was growing faster, ministering to more people, writing
more letters, printing more publications, sending out more teaching tapes than
ever before! It was a breakthrough time...a time for rejoicing. But I didn't
know it because I was too busy thinking about the problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I was so tunnel visional, all I
could see was the pressure, and I suffered through some hard times when I
should have been shouting the victory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But thank God, He woke me up
before it was over. He woke me up to the blessings and reminded me that the
problems are temporary, or subject to change, but God and His Word of victory
are never subject to change!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you've been suffering through
some hard times lately, wake up to the blessings around you. You'll be much
more effective in battling the problems if you're giving God the glory for the
solutions He's already provided. Take your eyes off the trouble and look around
you. You'll soon be shouting the victory!</p>
