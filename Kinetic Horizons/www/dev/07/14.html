<h1>Your Deadly Enemy </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'>I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them
which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if
we believe that Jesus died and rose again.... 1 Thessalonians 4:13</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Many of us, even though we're
believers, have seen grief and sorrow as such a natural part of life that we
haven't even questioned them. In fact, if we're honest, we'd have to admit
there are times when we actually want to feel sad and sorry for ourselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Why would we choose to feel
sorrow? Because sorrow has an emotional kick to it. It offers a surge of
feeling that, in the beginning stages, is almost intoxicating.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But grief and sorrow are
dangerous things. Several years ago God showed me that they're not the innocent
emotions we've thought they were. The force behind these emotions are actually
spirit beings sent by the devil himself to kill, steal and destroy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>They are a part of the
devastating, satanic barrage Jesus took on Himself when He died on the Cross
(Is. 53). He bore grief and sorrow, so we wouldn't have to. If they come
knocking on your door, remember, they are not innocent emotions. They are
deadly enemies that Jesus already carried away at Calvary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.2pt;margin-bottom:7.05pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:132%'>Don't live as those who have no hope.
You're a believer. You know that Jesus Christ died for you and rose again. That
not only gives you hope where physical death is concerned, it gives you hope in
every situation. Sorrow not!  <b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>Isaiah 51:11-16</b></p>
