<h1>Discourage the Devil </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.8pt;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:2.4pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center'>Blessed
are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their
company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.9pt;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:2.4pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center'>the
Son of man's sake. Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your
reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the
prophets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:2.4pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center'>Luke
6:22-23</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:5.3pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you want to know how to
depress the devil? Just follow the instructions in that last verse. When
persecution comes, when friends or family criticize you because you lay hands
on the sick and believe in healing, and when coworkers call you a fanatic
because you love Jesus and aren't afraid to say so, rejoice!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Shout hallelujah and leap for
joy!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I tell you that will discourage
the devil to no end. He's expecting that persecution to hurt you. He's
expecting it to damage your faith, to wipe you out, and to leave you in dismay.
I'm not saying you should enjoy the persecution itself. But you can learn to
overlook the discomfort of those things by focusing your attention on the
reward that's coming and the fact that Jesus said you are blessed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Apostle Paul certainly knew
how to do that. He was an expert on rejoicing in the midst of persecution.
Satan was constantly stirring up trouble for him. But do you know what he said
about all that persecution? He said it was not even worth considering compared
to the glory that was about to be revealed. If Paul could rejoice in the midst
of beatings, stonings, shipwrecks, imprisonment and almost every other kind of
persecution, you can too!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Just do what he did. When he was
told by the Holy Ghost that bonds and afflictions awaited him, he said,
&quot;But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto
myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I
have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of
God&quot; (Acts 20:24).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't get all caught up in what
people think and what people say down here on earth. Get caught up in pleasing
the Lord. Get caught up in finishing your course with joy. Get caught up in the
glorious hope that's ahead. For that hope is enough to make anyone--under any
circumstances--leap for joy!</p>
