<h1>Tap Into the Truth </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:99%'>When he, the
Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not
speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he
will show you things to come. John 16:13</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus said the Holy Spirit would
guide us into all truth. Not just enough truth to get by on. Not just an
occasional truth to help us teach our Sunday school classes. All truth! If
you're a businessman, that means the Holy Spirit will show you how to increase
your profits and reduce your expenses. If you're a mother, it means the Holy
Spirit will show you how to settle arguments between your children. If you're a
student, it means the Holy Spirit will show you how to excel in your classes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In fact, if you know Jesus Christ
and are baptized in the Holy Ghost, somehow inside you is the answer to every
financial problem, every spiritual problem and every physical problem that
exists. You have answers for problems you don't even know about yet! Back
during World War II, for example, the United States ran into some serious
trouble. Their ships were being sunk by the enemy faster than they could build
new ones, a process which at that time took a year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In an effort to solve their
dilemma, a method was devised by which a ship could be built in a single day.
The problem was, the process involved building the ship upside down and, when
the ships were turned upright, the welds would pop and the ship would come
apart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The problem was presented to a
deeply spiritual man who was a famous industrialist at the time. &quot;I'll
find out how to do it,&quot; he said. And, sure enough, after days of prayer
and fasting, God showed him the welding formula that would hold the ship
together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you're facing a problem today,
don't drag around trying to handle it on your own. Take Jesus at His Word and
start asking the Holy Spirit to give you the knowledge you need to solve it.
Put the wisdom of the ages to work on your job, in your family and in your
world. Tap into the truths He's placed in you.</p>
