<h1>No Hard Hearts </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'>For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole
earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect
toward him. 2 Chronicles 16:9</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Pharisees had a heart
condition that grieved Jesus. Their hearts were hard and insensitive. If you'll
look in Mark 3, you'll see what I'm talking about. God was right there in their
midst and they, of all people, should have realized it. They knew the Scriptures
backward and forward, and Jesus fit every messianic prophecy written there. But
the insensitivity of their hearts literally blinded them to who He was. The
hearts of the Pharisees were also hardened to the needs of the people around
them. That very same thing is still happening today. Just think again about
what those Pharisees were doing. They were:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:13.3pt;text-indent:-13.3pt'><span
style='line-height:107%'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></span>Criticizing
the minister of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:13.3pt;text-indent:-13.3pt'><span
style='line-height:107%'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></span>Protecting
their religious traditions instead of obeying the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:13.3pt;text-indent:-13.3pt'><span
style='line-height:107%'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></span>Worrying
about their own welfare rather than that of those around them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Have you ever known any believers
who fit that description? Sure you have! In fact, every one of us has done
those things at some time in our lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Every one of us, to one degree or
another, has fallen prey to the same mistake the Pharisees did. We've gotten so
caught up in doing and saying all the &quot;right&quot; things that we've let
the tender warmth of God's love inside us grow cold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I know that's true because if it
weren't, we'd be seeing tremendous moves of God among us. We'd be seeing
revival on every corner. That's what God longs to do. God longs to pour out His
Spirit in supernatural power and abundance through His Church. But we've
developed a heart condition that's holding Him back. Today if you are desiring
an outpouring of the Holy Spirit in your life and the manifestation of His
power in your church, check the condition of your heart. If you find any
hardness there, repent and ask God to change you. Ask Him to give you the kind
of heart that will allow Him to show Himself strong on your behalf.</p>
