<h1>Give More--Not Less </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.95pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:normal'>There is that scatters, and yet increases; and there is
that with holds more than is meet, but it tends to poverty. Proverbs 11:24</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>When money gets tight, it's always a temptation to cut down
on your giving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>After all, it seems like the
logical thing to do. Don't do it! You'll end up cutting off the flow of God's
financial blessings just when you need them most. I faced that kind of
situation just a few years ago. This ministry had fallen behind financially-one
million dollars to be exact. Gloria and I had been living by faith for 20 years
at that time. We knew firsthand that God would meet our needs--&quot;according
to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus&quot; (Phil. 4:19). We'd seen God prove
that over and over again, not only in our personal lives but in the life of our
ministry as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Yet this particular time, all the
prayers and the faith that had brought us victory before just didn't seem to
get the job done. In fact, as time went on, the situation grew worse instead of
better. By the end of the year our deficit had grown to be a million dollars.
Frustrated and weary, I finally went to God one day and laid the situation out
before Him. &quot;Lord,&quot; I said, &quot;You see the condition of this
ministry. I need a million dollars just to break even.&quot; &quot;Oh no, you
don't!&quot; the Lord replied. I could hardly believe it. How could He possibly
be telling me that I didn't need a million dollars? Hadn't He looked at the
books? Hadn't He talked to my accountant? I was stumped. All I could figure was
that I'd misunderstood something. So I went through it all again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Again He said, &quot;Oh no, you
don't.&quot; Despite my initial confusion, as I kept asking and listening, I
began to understand what the Lord was telling me. He was saying that the red
ink on the books wasn't the only thing wrong. There was a bigger problem behind
it. Then He showed me what I needed to do was to start giving ten percent of
the ministry's income into ministering to the poor. To the natural mind that
looked like no solution at all. How do you solve a deficit by giving away what
money you've got? But when I applied that solution, the million dollar deficit
began to disappear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Remember that next time the devil
tries to put the squeeze on you. Break his hold on your finances by giving more
instead of less. It won't be long until the prosperity of God is poured out on
you!</p>
