<h1>Nothing to Lose<b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'></span></b></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.9pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'>Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for
they shall eat the fruit of their doings. Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill
with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him. Isaiah 3:10-11</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Have you ever been afraid to give
yourself totally to the Lord because you think you might be deprived of some
pleasure in this life? Chances are, you have. That's because Satan is working
overtime to convince you that he can really make your life worth living. But don't
believe him for a minute. The real truth is, yielding completely to the Lord
won't cost you anything that's worth having. It will only cause you to live
life to its fullest!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus' life on earth was a
perfect example of a totally yielded life. He was a walking example of the
benefits godly living brings. Everywhere He went, Jesus made the deaf to hear,
the blind to see, the lame to walk. He lived in perfect peace and absolute
victory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That all sounds pretty good to
me. All He missed out on was the devil getting dominion over Him to kill, steal
and destroy. In fact, the devil couldn't do anything to Him until, by the
Father's will, He laid down His life. Until that time Jesus walked in total
victory over the enemy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you think you would miss out
on a lot if you lived that way? Of course not! You can walk in that same
anointing and power and glory of God that Jesus did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you have to give up your whole
life to do it? Yes! You have to trade your life for the life of God. You have
to trade your sickness for His healing, your poverty for His prosperity, your
anxiety for His peace, your sin for His righteousness. So why hesitate? When it
gets right down to it, you really have nothing to lose.<b> </b></p>
