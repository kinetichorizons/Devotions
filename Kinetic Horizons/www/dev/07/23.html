saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and
ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had
been with Jesus. Acts 4:13</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
line-height:110%'>How would you like to be so full of the glory of God that
it's unmistakable to those around</span> you? How would you like for people to
be able to know just by looking at you that you'd been with Jesus? It's
entirely possible if you are born again and filled with the Holy Spirit. The
same mighty power that changed you inwardly when you were saved can so
revolutionize you outwardly that even strangers on the street will be able to
see Jesus in you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>One of my favorite testimonies is
the one Jerry Savelle tells of the time he was in a shopping mall with his wife
Carolyn. He was sauntering from one store to another, casually passing time
until Carolyn finished her shopping. A woman walked up to Jerry and said,
&quot;Will you pray for me?&quot; Since he didn't know the woman, he was
puzzled. &quot;Out of all the people in that mall, how was it that she'd picked
him out?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>She said, &quot;The Lord told me
to come to this mall and someone would be here who could pray for me. I came
here looking for that person. I noticed a beam of light. It would go into one
store, wander around, then go to another store and wander around some more. I
followed the light until I found where it was coming from--and it was coming
from you!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What was that light? The glory of
God! It was shining from Jerry much like it shone from the face of Moses when
he came down from Mount Sinai. And that radiant presence of God brought healing
to that woman when Jerry prayed. Just as the fact that Peter and John had been
with Jesus was unmistakable, so was the fact that Jerry Savelle had been with
Jesus when that lady walked up to him in the mall. When you spend time with
Jesus, it will be undeniable. His power and His glory will be reflected in you
to the world. And His presence upon you will meet needs everywhere you go. Take
time to be with Jesus today!</p>
