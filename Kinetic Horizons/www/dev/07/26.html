<h1>Feast on the Word </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:105%'>Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that
proceeds out of the mouth of God. Matthew 4:4</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Word of God is to your spirit
as bread is to your body. When your body feeds on physical food, it produces a
physical power called strength. When your spirit feeds on the spiritual food of
the Word, it produces spiritual power called faith. And just as you can't eat
one meal and then feed on the memory of it for several weeks, you can't just
remember what the Word says and stay strong in faith. You have to read it. Even
if you've read it a hundred times, you need to read it again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Try this: Close your eyes and see
yourself slicing a lemon. Now stick that lemon slice between your teeth and
when I say, &quot;Three,&quot; bite down on it so hard that the juice squirts
into your mouth. One. Two. Three. Bite! Chances are, you have such a vivid
memory of what it's like to bite on a lemon that your mouth is watering right
now. But let me ask you this, &quot;Have you received any nourishment from that
memory?&quot; No.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Remembering the Word of God isn't
enough. You must continually feed on what it says. Get it out and read it. Go
to church and hear it preached. One day, you'll read a familiar verse...a verse
you've read thousands of times before...and suddenly God will give you the
greatest revelation you've ever had. A completely fresh revelation from that
old familiar verse! And it's likely to be exactly what you needed to know about
your current situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Yes, you can feed on the Word
that is on deposit in your spirit. But remember this: You can't get continued
results if you don't spend time in prayer and in the Word of God allowing the
Spirit to nourish you daily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't try to live on the memory
of your last spiritual meal. Replenish the force of faith within you. Feast on
the Word of God today.</p>
