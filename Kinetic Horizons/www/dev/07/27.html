<h1>Be Separate </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.85pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:normal'>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate,
says the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you  2
Corinthians 6:17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We're surrounded by a world which
is ruled for the most part by Satan. How can we avoid getting caught up in it?
How can we stand apart? You'll find the answer in John 17:17. There Jesus was
speaking to the Father about all those who would believe on Him. &quot;Sanctify
them through thy truth,&quot; He said. &quot;Thy word is truth.&quot; Sanctify
means &quot;to separate unto.&quot; So Jesus was saying, &quot;Separate them by
the Word.&quot; The Word separates!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When you initially believed the
Word of God, you were born again. You were separated spiritually from the
kingdom of darkness and separated to the kingdom of Light. Now that's where a
lot of people stop. They let the Word of God do its initial separating work and
then go right on living like everybody else. Spiritually, they're still separated
from death. But physically and mentally, they're up to their necks in it.
They're poor. They're sick. They're worried. They're confused. They're upset.
In other words, they're just like everyone else in the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But if you'll give the Word of
God first place in your life, it will continue to separate you from the poverty
and the anxiety and the sickness and the hatred and the darkness of your old
habitat. There's something else that the Word of God will do for you too. It
will not only separate you from the things of this world, it will separate you
to the things of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You can't simply separate
yourself from any old destructive habit without separating yourself to
something else. You can't turn away from the things of the world unless you
turn to something stronger. I'm telling you, you can scream and squall and kick
the altar bench and everything else trying to get rid of the sin in your life.
You can cry, &quot;Dear God, take this sin away from me.&quot; But all the
begging in the world won't separate you from your sin. It's the Word that does
it! Make a decision to give the Word first place in your life. Make it a
quality decision, a decision from which there is no retreat. Lock into the Word
and let the Word do its work. Let it separate you from the things of the world
and to the things of God.</p>
