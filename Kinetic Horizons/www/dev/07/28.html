<h1>We're Winning </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'>Only rebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye the people
of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is departed from them,
and the Lord is with us: fear them not. Numbers 14:9</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Thousands of years ago, God told
the children of Israel to go up and occupy the land that He had given them. He
told them to take it, by force and without fear, from the ungodly ones who were
dwelling there. He's still saying that today. God is still trying to get us, as
His people, to take the good land He's given us. He's still trying to get us to
use the power He's given us to run the wicked one out. You see, this earth
doesn't belong to the devil. It belongs to God (Ps. 24:1). The devil has just
moved in and taken control of things because we believers haven't stopped him. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>That is our job, you know. Jesus took
Satan's legal rights away from him on Resurrection morning. Then Jesus put us
in charge of enforcing Satan's defeat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Scripture says that Jesus is
going to sit at the right hand of the Father until His enemies are made His
footstool (Heb. 10:12-13). Do you know what that means? It means Jesus is
waiting on us to kick the devil and his crew out of the affairs of this earth.
He's waiting on us to carry out the victory He won at Calvary and occupy this
land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But just like Israel had to rise
up physically to take the land of Canaan, you and I have to rise up in the
Spirit if we're going to establish the dominion of God in the earth. We're
going to have to get moving. We can't do it sitting down! Listen, you may not
know it, but we're at war. We're in a spiritual battle--and we're winning. In
fact, if you realized what was already established in the spirit world, you'd
laugh at the devil every time he showed his face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So today if the devil has control
of an area of your life or your church or your community, rise up in the Spirit
through faith and prayer and the Word and start taking that territory back.
Don't be afraid. His defense is departed from him. He has no weapon that can stand
against you. The Lord is with you. Rise up in the Name of Jesus and take back
the land!</p>
