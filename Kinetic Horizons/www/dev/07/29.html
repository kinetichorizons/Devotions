<h1>Step Into the Light </h1>

Psalm 119:105</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As long as you live by the Word
of God, you never have to be in the dark again. You never have to remain in
confusion about which path to take. You never have to grope blindly along,
struggling to find your own way. Isn't that great? Isn't it exciting to know
that the Word of God will give you all the light you need every day of your
life if you'll allow it to?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Build your faith in that Word and
renew your commitment to it as you make this confession today: &quot;Father, in
the Name of Jesus, I commit myself to walk in Your Word. I recognize that Your
Word is integrity itself-- steadfast, sure, eternal--and I trust my life to its
provisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;You have sent Your Word
forth into my heart. I let it dwell in me richly in all wisdom. It does not
depart out of my mouth; I meditate in it day and night so that I may diligently
act on it. Your Word is an incorruptible seed, abiding in my spirit, and it's
growing mightily in me now, producing Your nature, Your life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;I thank You, Father, that
Your Word is my counsel, my shield, my buckler, my powerful weapon in battle.
It is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path. It makes my way straight
before me, and I never stumble or fall for my steps are ordered by Your Word.
&quot;I recognize the strategies and deceits of Satan and I put a stop to them
by speaking Your Word out of my mouth in faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;I am confident, Father,
that You are at work in me both to will and to do Your good pleasure. I exalt
Your Word. I hold it in high esteem and give it first place in my life. I
boldly and confidently say that my heart is fixed and established on the solid
foundation--the living Word of God. Amen!&quot;</p>
