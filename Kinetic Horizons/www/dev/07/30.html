<h1>You Don't Have to Fall </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.6pt;

line-height:104%'>Brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election
sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.25pt;margin-left:1.1pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>2
Peter 1:10</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You shall never fall. When you
think about it, that's a startling statement, isn't it? Most of us have been
tripped up by the devil so many times we don't like to think about it. But the
Word of God says it doesn't have to be that way. He says there's something that
can keep us on our feet. What is it? Diligence. If you haven't already, you
need to realize how important diligence is. You need to face the fact that you
simply can't live a life of victory without it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You can't stand strong on the
Word of God and not pick your Bible up during the week. Sunday morning alone
isn't going to get the job done. Yet most believers try to get by on that.
That's precisely why we have thousands of churches all over the world filled
with born-again people who don't have enough faith to blow their hats off. No
diligence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I remember several years ago when
I ministered to a lady who was healed of cancer. She'd gotten into the Word,
taken a stand of faith, and had been delivered. But several years later she
called me and said, &quot;Brother Copeland, I wish you'd pray for me. This
cancer has come back on me again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Right away I recalled the
scripture the Lord had given us to stand on those years before: &quot;No weapon
formed against you shall prosper.&quot; So I said, &quot;Get your Bible and
let's go back to Isaiah 54:17.&quot; In the background I could hear her whispering
to someone else in the room, &quot;Where's my Bible?&quot; When I heard that, I
almost cried out. I knew she wasn't going to make it. Why? No diligence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Listen, this is a daily thing.
The devil's out there 24 hours a day devising ways to make us fall. Jesus is on
the throne 24 hours a day giving us power to resist him, and we need to be
exercising our faith all the time. If you're going to stand in the days ahead,
you're going to need a lot more than Sunday school faith. You're going to need
some full-grown, mountain-moving faith, and there's only one way to get that:
By giving yourself to the Word more diligently than you ever have before. Give
diligence to make your calling and election sure; and no matter how slippery
the situation gets, you won't have to fall!</p>
