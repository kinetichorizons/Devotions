<h1>Let It Flow </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.0pt;margin-left:1.25pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'>Whosoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall
never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of
water springing up into everlasting life. John 4:14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Love. Joy. Peace. Patience.
Gentleness. Goodness. Faith. Meekness. Temperance. Powerful forces the Bible
calls the fruit of the Spirit. They're the character traits of God Himself and
when the Holy Spirit came to dwell in you, He brought them with Him, so they
could become your character traits too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>They're designed to bubble up
inside you, to gush forth like a powerful stream constantly protecting and
cleansing you from the inside out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Have you ever noticed that you
can't put any trash in the mouth of a flowing fountain? When it's shooting that
water up, the force of its own outflow protects it and keeps it clear of any
impurities from the outside. Well, the spiritual fountain within you works the
same way. When you're allowing the forces of love and joy and peace and
gentleness and all the others to flow out, the devil can't get any of his junk
in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>How do you keep the Spirit
flowing? You pump your heart so full of the Word of God that the forces of
eternal life start bubbling out. Just a little at first...and then stronger and
higher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.05pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:132%'>Choose to keep those forces streaming out
of the fountain of your heart. Refuse to let selfishness and sin stop the flow.
You have a fountain filled with unbeatable LIFE forces inside you and it's
ready to come forth. Let it flow! <b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>Jeremiah 17:7-13</b>
