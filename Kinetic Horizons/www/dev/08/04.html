<h1>Receive His Mercy </h1>

line-height:105%'>O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his mercy
endures for ever.  Psalm 136:1</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God's mercy endures forever! His
willingness to act on man's behalf is still operating in the earth. His mercy
never runs out. Neither has it abated or weakened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;Praise the Lord! His mercy
endures forever!&quot; Mighty and powerful things happened when Israel said
these words. They are words of praise and adoration to God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When Solomon finished building
the house of the Lord, the trumpeters and singers lifted their voices as one,
and with trumpets, cymbals, and instruments of music, they praised the Lord saying,
&quot;For He is good: for His mercy endures forever.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jehoshaphat appointed singers
unto the Lord to go before the army and say, &quot;Praise the Lord! For His
mercy endures forever.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It has been thousands of years
since the Lord said His mercy extended to a thousand generations, and His mercy
continues to reach you day after day. He is still plenteous in mercy unto them
that call upon Him. With your spirit, dare to stretch your faith to take in the
boundless mercy of God. And say with your mouth, &quot;The Lord He is good and
His mercy endures forever. His mercy surrounds me even today!&quot;</p>
