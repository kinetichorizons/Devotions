<h1>Let Your Life Begin Again </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:11.65pt;margin-left:1.3pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'>Behold, now is the day of salvation.2 Corinthians 6:2</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Did you know that Jesus has
unlocked the prison doors of guilt that have kept you captive? It doesn't
matter who you are or what you've been. I don't care if you've been a
prostitute, a murderer, a thief, a drug dealer, or a churchgoer who's never
made Jesus Christ Lord of your life. The Bible says that today is the day of
salvation. A new life is only a prayer away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Gloria and I discovered that for
ourselves more than 25 years ago. Actually, it was Gloria who took the first
step. She found out that the Bible said that not even a sparrow falls without
God's knowledge. &quot;Well,&quot; she thought, &quot;if God knows and cares
when the sparrows fall, He must know what terrible shape my life is in right
now. And if He cares, maybe He can do something with it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Gloria didn't know anything about
the Bible. She didn't even know for sure that God would let her start over. But
when she told Him she wanted Him to take over her life, something supernatural
happened on the inside of her. She was born again. &quot;But what about my
past?&quot; you may say. &quot;I feel so guilty about it!&quot; When you've
been born again and made a new creature in Christ--that past doesn't belong to
you anymore. And it would be ridiculous to walk around feeling guilty about
someone else's past, wouldn't it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What would you think if I took a
little baby on my lap, a pretty little thing just a few months old, and said,
&quot;Oh, isn't she precious? But just think about her past.&quot; You'd think
I was crazy! &quot;What past?&quot; you'd say. &quot;She doesn't have any
past!&quot; Well, it's the same way with you once you've been born again. You
don't have any past. Your life begins again the day you make Jesus Lord of your
life. Then, when Satan comes around trying to remind you of what a worm you
were before, just tell him he's knocking on the wrong door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You've been kicked around long
enough. There's no need to wait any longer. The prison door is open. Walk
through to Jesus and let your life begin again today.</p>
