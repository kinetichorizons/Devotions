<h1>Possess God's Rest </h1>

line-height:99%'>There remains therefore a rest to the people of God....Let us
labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same
example of unbelief. Hebrews 4:9, 11</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God's rest. Considering the
hectic, busy lives you and I live that sounds like a pretty good thing to have,
doesn't it? But exactly what is that rest? And how do we enter it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The third and fourth chapters of
Hebrews compares God's rest with the children of Israel taking possession of
the Promised Land. That land was to be a place where their every need would be
met, a place of freedom from their warring enemies, a place no one would ever
drive them from again. All they had to do was go in and possess it. But
something kept them from it: unbelief and disobedience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As believers, we, too, have the
opportunity to enter a Promised Land of abundance and peace. A land where we
can rest from our struggles and enjoy the victory of God. To enter it we must
do what the children of Israel failed to do. We must simply trust God and obey
His voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>How do you come to that place of
trust and obedience? By getting to know your Father. By spending time
fellowshiping with Him in prayer and in the Word. That is the labor that will
bring you into His rest!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I'll never forget when I first
discovered that. I had been learning the principles of faith, striving hard to
do them. It seemed back then that keeping doubt and unbelief out of my heart
was difficult. Then, one day, I began to labor to know the Father instead of
just knowing about Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When I did that, He began to
reveal Himself to me. He gave me glimpses of His heart, His nature and His
love. As He revealed to me how much He wanted to do for His children, it
changed my striving into peace, my doubt into trust, my fear into bold
obedience. It enabled me to enter His rest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Get to know your Father. Work at
it. Make it your &quot;labor.&quot; He has a Promised Land of rest that is
waiting for you!</p>
