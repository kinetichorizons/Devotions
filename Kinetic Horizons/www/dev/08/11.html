<h1>Meditate on the Word </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>And [God] brought [Abram] forth
abroad, and said, look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able
to number them: and he said unto him, so shall thy seed be. And he believed in
the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:11.65pt;margin-left:.35pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;

Genesis 15:5-6</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you ever have trouble
believing the Word of God? Not just agreeing with it mentally, but really
believing that what it says will work for you? I do. There are times when the
promises in the Word stagger my mind. There have been times when I've felt so
defeated and the circumstances around me looked so bad that it was tough for me
to believe I was &quot;more than a conqueror&quot; even though I knew God said
I was. What do you do when your mind staggers like that at the promise of God?
You meditate on that promise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Scriptural meditation simply
means thinking about and reflecting on the Word of God. It means pondering a
particular scripture and mentally applying it to your own circumstances again
and again until that scripture permanently marks your consciousness. That kind
of meditation can affect your life in a way that almost nothing else can. It
can, quite literally, alter your mind. That's what happened to Abram. When God
first told him that he was going to father a nation, he was an old man. His
wife, Sara, was also old. What's more, she had been barren all her life. How
could an aging, childless couple have even one child--much less a nation full
of them? Abram couldn't even imagine such a thing. It contradicted his entire
mind-set.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But God knew the mental struggle
Abram would have, so He didn't just make him a verbal promise and leave it at
that. He gave Abram a picture of that promise to meditate on. He took him out
into the starry night, turned his eyes to the sky and said, &quot;So shall thy
seed be.&quot; Can't you just see Abram staring out at the stars, trying to
count them? Filling the eyes of his heart with the promise of God?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's what meditation is all
about. Taking time to envision the promise of God until it becomes a reality
inside you. It's tremendously powerful, and by focusing on the scriptural
promises God has given you, you can put it to work in your life just as Abram
put it to work in his.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't just read the Word.
Meditate on it today.</p>
