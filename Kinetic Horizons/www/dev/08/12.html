<h1>A Supernatural Cycle of Blessing </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

line-height:105%'>Cast thy bread upon the waters: for you shall find it after
many days. Ecclesiastes 11:1</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>One of the most exciting things I
ever discovered about God's law of sowing and reaping was the fact that
financial harvests are not seasonal. If you plant year round, you can be
receiving year round.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't misunderstand. I'm not
saying your harvest will come instantly. It usually won't. You may have to wait
for it for several months. What I'm saying is, if you'll keep planting
consistently, you'll receive just as consistently. If you'll continually cast
your bread on the water, eventually it will come in on every wave!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Of course, some people never get
to enjoy that kind of constant blessing. That's because, instead of giving,
they keep waiting to receive. They stand on the beach saying, &quot;I wonder
where my prosperity is? As soon as it comes in, I'll start giving.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God's economy doesn't work that
way. He said, &quot;Give and it will be given to you again. The way you measure
it, it shall be measured back to you&quot; (Luke 6:38). You have to make the
first move. You have to send a ship out before your ship can come in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Think about that next time you're
tempted to complain about the things life brings your way. Remember that
whatever you've been casting out there is always what you find on down the
road. If you've been giving doubt, unbelief and fear, that's what has been
coming to you. If you've been giving nothing, then nothing is what you get.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You're holding the seeds of your
own future in your hand right now. Step out in faith and use them to put the
supernatural cycle of blessing in motion. Start now planting one good seed
after another. Eventually you'll enjoy a good harvest every single day!</p>
