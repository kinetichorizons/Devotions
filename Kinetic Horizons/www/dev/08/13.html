line-height:99%'>Lord so as to guide and instruct [Him] and give Him knowledge?
But we have the mind of Christ, the Messiah, and do hold the thoughts (feelings
and purposes) of His heart. 1 Corinthians 2:16</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Isn't it exciting to realize that
you can hold the thoughts and feelings and purposes of God's very own heart in
your heart? Isn't it thrilling to know the Creator of heaven and earth wants to
be one spirit with you and transmit His thoughts to your mind?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>First Corinthians 6:17 says that
when you were joined to the Lord you became one spirit with Him. He came into
union with you so that He can talk to you heart to heart. God wants you in this
harmony with Him so that His thoughts can become your actions. He wants you to
walk so closely with Him that you never lack power to overcome the evil of this
world. He wants you to be so in tune with His Spirit that you are able to feel
His heart of compassion toward those around you who are hurting or bowed down
with sickness and pain. He wants to be one with you, so He can reach out
through your hands and fulfill His purposes in the earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Make a fresh commitment today to
walk in union with your God. Give your attention to His Spirit in your inner
man. Determine to yield to His voice and not to the voices of the world or the
flesh!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Allow the mind of Christ to flow
through you!</p>
