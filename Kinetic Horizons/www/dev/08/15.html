<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't ever short-circuit a
miracle by trying to see it in progress! So many believers do that. They'll lay
hands on someone and pray for healing or deliverance and then, when they don't
see any immediate, outward change take place, they'll withdraw their faith and
assume nothing happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Lord taught me an
unforgettable lesson about that once when I was in Jamaica. I was preaching to
a group of about 150 people in a church that was lighted only by a single
kerosene lantern. It was so dark I couldn't see anyone's face. All I could see
was my Bible and the feet of the man right in front of me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.05pt;

style='color:black;text-decoration:none'></span></a>expressions of the people
to whom I was preaching to determine how my sermon was being received. Knowing
what I did about faith, I knew that was dangerous. So I made a quality decision
at that moment never to preach another sermon except by faith. I would not be
swayed by the expressions of people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Before that series of meetings
was over, I<a

decision could be. The Jamaicans, who tend to show very little expression
anyway, sat through every sermon without any outward reaction at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>One lady was completely healed of
blindness during one of those meetings. She never let on that anything had
taken place. She was almost rigid when she found me outside and said simply,
&quot;Brother Copeland, I was blind, but now I can see. Thank you.&quot; That
was all! A miracle had taken place, and by watching, you wouldn't have been
able to tell anything had happened at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Next time you're tempted to
evaluate what God is doing by the looks of things, don't do it. Remember
instead that it is faith, not appearances, that makes miracles happen. It's the
only real evidence that you need!</p>
