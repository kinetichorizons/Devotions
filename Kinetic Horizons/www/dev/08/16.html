<h1>A Firm Foundation </h1>

line-height:107%'>These things I command you, that ye love one another. John
15:17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In Luke 6:47-48, Jesus said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;Whosoever cometh to me, and
hears my sayings, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like: He is
like a man which built an house, and dug deep, and laid the foundation on a
rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and
could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.&quot; That's probably a
familiar scripture to you. But today I want you to do something new with it. I
want you to put it together with what Jesus said in John 15:17:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>These things I command you, that
ye love one another. Love. That one word sums up all Jesus said for us to do.
If you'll build your life on it, even the most violent storms of this world
will be unable to shake you. It will make you solid in every area of your life.
If you'll build your family on love, you can win back those the devil has
stolen from you. You can win them to Jesus with the love of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you'll build your business on
love, you'll prosper beyond your wildest dreams. I had a friend who did that.
He went into a television and radio business in his church. He wanted to buy a
station from a Jewish man and he offered such a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>good price for it that the owner
was stunned. &quot;Why would you offer me such a wonderful price?&quot; asked
the Jewish owner. &quot;Because the Word of God says that if I will bless you,
God will bless me. So I'm going to see to it that you get the better part of
this deal,&quot; answered my friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Before it was all over, that
Jewish station owner had made Jesus Lord of His life. He and my friend ended up
prospering and preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ together on the radio. When
love rules, prosperity can flow! Commit to living the life of love today.
Commit to building your house upon the rock. Then when the storms of life begin
to blow--at home, at work, or in any situation--you can enjoy the solid
security of knowing that love never fails.</p>
