<h1>See Yourself Risen With Jesus </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:105%'>Constantly keep in mind Jesus Christ, the Messiah, [as] risen
from the dead. 2 Timothy 2:8</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>This is the key to holding onto
the blessings of God. When pressure comes, when troubles and trials are bearing
down on you, remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Remember that when Jesus arose,
you arose. When He came out of hell and defeated the enemy, you came out of
hell and defeated the enemy. His victory is your victory because you're in
Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In the hard places, remember
that. When the devil tells you you're not going to get your answer this time,
remember that. When he tells you there's no way out, you remember Christ, the
Anointed One, the Victorious Conqueror, risen from the dead and seated at the
right hand of the Father!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If there's an image Satan hates
more than any other, it must be that image of Jesus, rising from the dead,
stripping him forever of his authority, and openly displaying his defeat to all
of heaven and hell. That's the picture you need to keep in the forefront of
your mind. Think about it until it's etched into your heart so deeply that
nothing Satan says or does can get it out of you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's when the gifts of God will
be established in your life. That's when the devil won't be able to talk you
out of your inheritance with trials and tribulations. Keep in mind Jesus
Christ, risen from the dead!</p>
