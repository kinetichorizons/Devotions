<h1>When Somebody Does You Wrong </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.85pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:normal'>Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and
scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means
hurt you. Luke 10:19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Somebody's done you wrong! Sooner
or later it happens to all of us. Somewhere along the way, we all get hurt or
cheated or lied to or abused. It's as predictable as it is painful. Yet when it
happens most of us find ourselves strangely unprepared. In our outrage, we
often cry out to God against the one who wronged us. We ask for justice, or
even vengeance, and end up making things tougher on everyone
involved--including ourselves. If that's been true of you, it's time you found
out how you can put the power of God to work for you the next time somebody
does you wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Step one: Identify the enemy!
Right here's where the majority of us make our biggest blunder. We mistakenly
identify our enemy as the person who hurts us. Don't waste your energy ranting
and raving or plotting and scheming against people who cause you pain. They're
simply under the devil's influence. Aim your spiritual ammunition at the right
target. It's the devil who's behind it all. Go after him!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Step two: Fire! Once you've
pointed your spiritual guns in the right direction, fire! Hit the devil fast
and furiously with the Word of God. Use the Name of Jesus and the power that's
been given you as a believer and bind the devil from doing you any further harm
in that area. Then move on to the next and most important part of this
spiritual battle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Step three: Pray the prayer of
intercession. In Matthew 5:44-45, Jesus gives us these instructions: &quot;Love
your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and
pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; That ye may be the
children of your Father which is in heaven.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Crying out for the vengeance of
God to strike like a lightning bolt when somebody does us wrong isn't acting
like our Father. Remember God has great, great mercy. Not just for me and you,
but for everyone! The devil will probably think twice before he bothers you
again. Next time someone causes you pain, put the power of God to work for you.
Identify the real enemy. Hit him hard with the authority you've been given as a
believer. Then pray the prayer of intercession.</p>
