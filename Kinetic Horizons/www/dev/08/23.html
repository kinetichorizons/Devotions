<h1>Leaving the Low Life Behind </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.85pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:normal'>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and
whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it Matthew 16:25</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The high life...or the low life?
God's kind of life...or the world's kind of life? You can't have them both.
It's one or the other. You have to choose. You may try to put off that choice.
You may try to hang on to the low life while reaching out for the high life at
the same time, so you can see if it's something you really want before you give
up everything the world has to offer. But, believe me, you're not that tall!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You'll never be able to sample
the high life for yourself until you're willing to let go, until you're willing
to take God at His Word and trust Him to take care of you. What will happen to
you when you do that? You'll start living the kind of life God describes in
Psalm</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> 1. You'll be like &quot;a tree
planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth fruit in season; your leaf
also shall not wither; and whatsoever you do shall prosper.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In West Texas talk that means
your roots will go down so deep that no drought can dry you up and no storm can
blow you down. No matter what happens in the world around you, you'll prosper. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The stronger the wind blows, the
more you'll bend in the breeze. Depression and inflation won't be able to break
you. When the rains stop coming and everyone else is withering away, you'll
just keep on thriving and bearing the fruit of the Spirit because you're
drawing up nourishment from the riverbed!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's what the high life is like
and there's nothing that the world has to offer that can even compare. I know
that from experience. Once you dare to let go and trust God...so will you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.7pt;
