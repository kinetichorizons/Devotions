<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:193.7pt;text-indent:-193.0pt'>Thus have
ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. Matthew 15:6</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.2pt'>Cancer. Heart disease. Multiple
sclerosis. When we think of killer diseases, those are the names that come to
mind. But the truth is, there's a far more deadly killer on the loose in the
Church today. And it's destroyed more lives than any of us can imagine. It's
called tradition. Traditions rob believers of their healing. They steal the
power from the promises of God. Here are three you should beware of:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:13.85pt;text-indent:-13.15pt'><span
style='line-height:107%'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></span>The
tradition that says it's not always God's will to heal you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.2pt'>It is God's will to heal you! It
says so in His Word. If you don't believe that it is, then you can't pray in
faith believing you'll receive. You're like the farmer who sits on his porch
and says, &quot;I believe in crops, but I'm not going to plant any seed this
year. I'll just believe, and if it's God's will, my crop will come up.&quot;
That farmer will never see his crop. Faith is the seed of healing--if you don't
plant it, it won't grow. A prayer that includes the words, &quot;If it be thy
will&quot; won't produce a healing harvest. You must know without a doubt that
healing is always God's will for you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:13.85pt;text-indent:-13.15pt'><span
style='line-height:107%'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></span>Another
tradition we hear is that healing has passed away. That there are no miracles
today. But the Word of God proves that's not true. In Exodus 15:26, God says,
&quot;I am the Lord that healeth thee.&quot; He also tells us that He does not
change (Mal. 3:6). He has never changed since the beginning of time. For
healing to pass away, God would have to pass away...and He is not about to do
that!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:13.85pt;text-indent:-13.15pt'><span
style='line-height:107%'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></span>The
third dangerous tradition is this one: &quot;God gets glory from Christians
being sick.&quot; That tradition totally violates the Word of God. The Bible
says that people gave glory to God when they saw the lame walk and the blind
see. God receives glory from your healing--not your pain!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:1.2pt'>The world is looking for a way out
of sickness and disease, not a way into it. Let's break down those traditions
and deliver a hurting world from the most dangerous killer of all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.7pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>Mark
2:1-12</b></p>
