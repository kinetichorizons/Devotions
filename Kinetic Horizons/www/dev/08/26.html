the Lord, when He delights in his way [and He busies Himself with his every
step]. Psalm 37:23</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God's will is to lead you on a
day-by-day basis. He's given His Spirit to guide you every day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Most believers don't know that.
They expect God to reveal His complete will for their lives in one big
revelation. Don't make that mistake. Don't just sit around waiting for God to
show you whether or not He wants you to go to Africa for the rest of your
life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Let Him begin to lead you in
little things first, to tell you what you need to do about this situation or
that one. He'll show you what you need to change. And, as He does, you'll
change one thing at a time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The truth is, you probably
already know one thing God wants you to do. You might not know why He wants you
to do it. You may not know where it's leading, but you've heard His voice in
your heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>If you want to keep on hearing Him,
you'll have to set aside your own ambitions and desires. Spend time in prayer
and in the Word. Tune your ear to the voice of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>His Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Learn to trust Him. Remember that
He's smarter than you are and be willing to do what He says whether you can
understand it with your mind or not. Obey even His smallest instructions. If
you do, He'll eventually change your whole life...one little step at a time.</p>
