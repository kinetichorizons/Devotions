<h1>Not of This World </h1>

line-height:normal'>Whatever is born of God is victorious over the world; and
this is the victory that conquers the world, even our faith. 1 John 5:4</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Years ago the devil started a
rumor. He told a few Christians that as long as they lived in the world, they
had to suffer as the world did. He told them they had to share the diseases and
the defeat, the poverty and the failure of those around them. It was a crafty
lie--and it worked. Believers accepted it and began to spread it among
themselves. You may have even heard it yourself. If so, I want to help you put
that rumor to rest today. I want to help you get the facts straight once and
for all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You see, despite what you may
have heard, health, prosperity and victorious living aren't concepts some
comfort-hungry believer selfishly dreamed up. They are God's ideas. You may
say, &quot;That sounds good, Gloria, but we've got to be realistic. We live in
a world that's full of problems. And as long as we live in this world, it seems
to me we're going to have our share.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Yes, that's true. Even Jesus
said, &quot;In the world you have tribulation and trials and distress and
frustration.&quot; But notice, He didn't stop there! He went on to say,
&quot;But be of good cheer-- take courage, be confident, certain, undaunted--for
I have overcome the world.-- I have deprived it of power to harm, have
conquered it [for you]&quot; (John 16:33, The Amplified Bible).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Most believers don't have any
trouble believing the first part of that verse. They know all too well how many
tribulations, trials, distresses, and frustrations surround them. But they're
less certain about the last part. They haven't yet experienced for themselves
exactly what Jesus meant when He said He had deprived those things of power to
harm them. Why not? Because they're still living as though they're part of the
world. But, listen. Jesus said you and I are to be &quot;sanctified,&quot; or
separated from the evils of this world. How? Through the Word of God! (John
17:17).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Word of God will separate you
from the world. His Word will set His dream for victory into motion in your
life. If you'll receive it and believe it, speak it and act on it, that Word
will set you apart from those around you. It will take you from trouble to
triumph again and again. <b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>John 17:1-17</b></p>
