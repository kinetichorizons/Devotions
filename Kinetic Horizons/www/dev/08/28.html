<h1>Abide in Jesus </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:20.55pt;

line-height:143%'><i><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:143%'>If a man
abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered. John 15:6</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If I were to ask you to make a
list of a hundred things you need to do to please the Lord today, you could do
it, couldn't you? In fact, you probably have so many spiritual &quot;do's&quot;
and &quot;don'ts&quot; cluttering up your mind that you'd hardly know where to
start.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But you can relax. I'm not going
to suggest you make a list of them. Instead, I'm going to help you simplify
things by giving you only one: Abide in Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The one thing you're truly
responsible for is your union with Him. If you keep your union and fellowship
with Him intact, everything else will be taken care of.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.75pt;margin-bottom:
10.7pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>&quot;But Gloria, I'm facing some big
problems right now. My life's turned upside down. I'm so rushed I don't know
whether I'm coming or going. I don't have time to fellowship with the Lord
today.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's when you need to do it the
most! You need to maintain your union with the Lord particularly when the
storms of life come. I know that's often not easy to do. Whether the storm is a
sickness in your body or financial problems or family strife, the temptation
will be to settle your attention and your mind on that problem. You won't even
want to think about anything else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's what the devil planned on.
That's the reason he sent that storm in the first place. To distract you from
fellowshiping with God. To draw your attention away from your union with Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't fall into the devil's trap.
Instead, keep your thoughts and affections trained on the Lord. As you do that,
the force of faith will begin to flow out of you. And that flow will repel
every form of darkness. It will bring you in triumph through every storm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Fellowship with Jesus today.</p>
