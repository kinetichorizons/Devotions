<h1>Put Your Spirit in Charge </h1>

line-height:normal'>So too the (Holy) Spirit comes to our aid and bears us up
in our weakness; for we do not know what prayer to offer...but the Spirit
Himself...pleads in our behalf</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.85pt;margin-left:1.95pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:normal'>with
unspeakable yearnings and groanings too deep for utterance. Romans 8:26</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As long as you live on this
earth, you're going to be saddled with a weakness. What is it? The flesh and
blood body you live in. It's a body that's subject to death. A body that's
subject to the physical world around you. Your reborn spirit doesn't want to
sin. It wants to be completely obedient to God. But the weakness of the flesh
causes you to fall prey to the temptations around you. Does that mean you're
doomed to a life of failure till Jesus comes and that flesh body is glorified? 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>No! It means you need to build
your spirit up, to strengthen it, until it dominates your flesh. We are told to
crucify the flesh. Your spirit man must dominate your body. Praying in the
Spirit by the Holy Spirit applies spirit to flesh. It causes your spirit to
rise up and take charge. Just like using barbells strengthens your arms,
praying in other tongues strengthens your spirit. You see, your spirit is more
powerful than your flesh, and as you give it outflow, the flesh will simply
have to yield to it. Most believers don't understand that. They'll be
overwhelmed by some sin, and instead of conquering it by the things of God such
as praying in the Spirit, they'll simply keep struggling to overcome in natural
ways. So they end up failing again and again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you're caught in that cycle,
take heart! God hasn't commanded you to be more spiritual than you can be. He
knows your weakness and He's given you a way to overcome it. He's given you the
ability to pray in tongues-- and with your understanding to wield the sword of
the Spirit which is the Word of God. And no matter how badly you're failing in
everything else, you can do these things!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Be warned though, Satan will try
to talk you out of it. He knows that once you learn how to bring the flesh in
line, he'll have no foothold left in your life. You'll shut the door on him and
he won't be able to get in. Renew your commitment to praying in the Spirit
today. Make a quality decision to follow the command God gives in Jude 20 and
&quot;build yourself up on your most holy faith-- make progress, rise like an
edifice higher and higher--praying in the Holy Spirit!&quot;</p>
