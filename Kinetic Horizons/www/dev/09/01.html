<h1>Perseverance Gets Results </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'>I tell you, although he will not get up and supply him
anything because he is his friend, yet because of his shameless persistence and
insistence, he will get up and give him as much as he needs Luke 11:8</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If, as God tells us in 1 Timothy
2:4, it's His will for all men to be saved, why aren't we seeing more of the
masses of lost people born again every day? Have you ever wondered that?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I have...and as I've sought the
Lord about it, I've come to realize that, for the most part, it's because those
of us who are already saved don't pray persistently for those who aren't.
Instead of persevering--staying before the Father, praying for them to receive
the bread of salvation--like the man in Luke 11:8 did for his friend, when we
don't see immediate results, we simply give up and go home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What we don't realize is this:
Perseverance is the key to success in intercession!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Why? It's certainly not because
you have to change God's mind. He never changes. His mind's made up. He wants
all men saved. The reason you have to persevere in intercession is to put
pressure on the demonic forces that are trying to keep God's will from being
accomplished. Those forces must be broken down through prayer so that
strongholds are destroyed and spiritual blinders are removed from the spiritual
eyes of the people you're praying for.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You see, God will not go against
the will of people. But He will move through your intercession to reveal
Himself. Through your persistent prayers, He will bring them to the knowledge
of their need for Him. Then they'll reach out for Him and spiritual rebirth can
take place!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you're sitting around waiting
on God to save Aunt Mary or Uncle Jim or your best friend...stop sitting
around! Get busy interceding for them. Persevere in prayer. Pray the prayer in
Ephesians 1:16-23 for them, refusing to give up until they're safely inside
God's kingdom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus has already laid down His
life so that they can be saved. The question is, will you?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.7pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>Luke
11:1-10</b></p>
