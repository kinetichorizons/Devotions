<h1>Go for Revelation Knowledge </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:105%'>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge
of God, and of Jesus our Lord.2 Peter 1:2</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you were to look up the Greek
word that's translated &quot;knowledge&quot; in that scripture, you'd find out
that it means more than just a mental understanding of something, more than the
kind of knowledge that can be gained through your senses. It means exact
knowledge. Knowledge that's been revealed directly to your heart by the Spirit
of God. I call it revelation knowledge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The lack of that kind of
knowledge has caused more faith failures than anything else I know. That's
because most Christians believe the Word with their minds, but they haven't
meditated on it enough for it to &quot;light up&quot; in their hearts. If they had,
that Word would absolutely revolutionize their lives. Nothing in heaven or
earth would be able to shake them loose from it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I know a widow who got hold of
that kind of revelation one afternoon. She'd been meditating in the scriptures
that say if you're a widow, God Almighty has taken His place as your provider
and leader of your household. She'd been feeling a little sorry for herself up
until then. But when she received the revelation that God was actually head of
her household now, she started talking to Him like she would a husband.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;I'm telling You, Lord, the
plumbing in this house is pitiful. Will You please get it fixed?&quot; she
said. From that moment on, she never had any more trouble with her plumbing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you need something from God,
determine right now that you're going to do what that widow did. Determine that
you're going to meditate the Word until you get a revelation like that. Keep
that Word before you until you receive a revelation of Jesus as your healer or
your deliverer or your financier--whatever you need Him to be. Don't settle for
a shallow mental understanding of Him. Get a deep revelation and His grace will
be multiplied to you!</p>
