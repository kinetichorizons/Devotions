line-height:105%'>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man
soweth, that shall he also reap. Galatians 6:7</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you feel like you're under
pressure these days, you're not alone. Satan is putting more pressure on more people
right now than ever before. He's pressuring us mentally, financially,
emotionally and every other way he can. The pressure has gotten so great
everywhere that governments don't know what to do. Businesses don't know what
to do. Families don't know. Churches don't know. But, praise God, Jesus does!
He says we can give our way right out from under any pressure the devil brings
to bear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Giving is always Jesus' way out.
Whenever there's a need, He plants seed! In fact, in Mark 4, He compares the
entire kingdom of God to a seed. Just think about the importance of seeds for a
moment. Every living thing on this earth came from a seed. You came from a
seed. Then you were born again from the seed of God's Word. Jesus Himself was
The Seed planted by God. God sowed Him in sacrifice. He came forth and grew up
into many brethren.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So, when Satan puts you under
pressure, go to Jesus and let Him tell you how and where to plant. If you'll do
it, that seed will grow up until it breaks the powers of darkness and lack. It
will release you from the pressure the devil's been putting on you. I've seen
it happen. When Jerry Savelle first began to work for my ministry, he didn't
have but one suit of clothes and one shirt with a pair of slacks to his name.
He wore one, then the other, night after night to every service we held. He
didn't have the money to even think about buying another suit. I'm telling you,
he was under pressure where clothes were concerned!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Then he found out about the
principle of seed-faith and harvest. So, he went downtown in the city where we
were in a meeting and found a fellow on the street who needed clothes and gave
him some. Immediately people started giving Jerry clothes. It started in that
meeting and they've been doing it ever since. Today, there are many preachers
in Africa wearing Jerry Savelle suits! (Even if the sleeves and pant legs are
way too short!) He's still sowing and reaping the greatest clothes harvest I've
ever seen. If the devil's pressuring you, don't panic...plant! Plant your time.
Plant your money. Plant the clothes off your back. When your harvest comes in,
you can laugh and say, &quot;Hey, Devil, who's feeling the pressure now?”</p>
