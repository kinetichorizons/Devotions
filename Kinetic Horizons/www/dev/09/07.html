<h1>Strike It Rich </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.85pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:normal'>And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and
heirs according to the promise. Galatians 3:29</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>One of the problems that hung around
me for years was poverty. But I remember the day I decided I wasn't going to be
poor anymore. I was reading in the Word where it says that the blessing of
Abraham has come upon the Gentiles by Jesus Christ (Gal. 3:14). Then I got down
to the twenty-ninth verse where it says, &quot;If ye be Christ's, then are ye
Abraham's seed, and HEIRS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>ACCORDING TO THE PROMISE.&quot;
Suddenly the truth hit me. I got so excited I could hardly stand myself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I turned back over to Deuteronomy
28 and--line by line--I read those promised blessings. &quot;Blessed in the
city, blessed in the country. Blessed going out, blessed coming in. Blessed in
your barns, blessed in your fields, blessed in all the works of your
hands.&quot; Man, I had struck it rich!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I'd been going to school in
Tulsa, Oklahoma, and I was living in a dumpy little house nobody would want to
live in. But when I read those promises in the Word, I saw the light. I
realized God already had redeemed me from the curse of poverty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Well, that afternoon in my back
bedroom, I took my Bible in my hand and I said: &quot;I want to announce to
Almighty God in heaven and to Jesus Christ of Nazareth, to all the angels of
heaven, to all the demons of hell, and to anybody else that cares anything
about hearing it, that from this day forward my needs are met according to
God's riches in glory by Christ Jesus.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I told Him, &quot;I'm standing on
Your Word, and I'm looking to You to take care of me. I'll never ask a man for
a dollar.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That was many years ago and I
never have. You know why? Because that decision connected me to the power of
God. It'll do the same for you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'><b>Scripture Reading:</b>
Deuteronomy 28:1-13</p>
