<h1>Exercise Your Rights </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>He was wounded for our transgressions, he
was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and
with his stripes we are healed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-8.0pt;
margin-bottom:12.25pt;margin-left:.5pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>Isaiah
53:5</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus came to earth and gave
Himself as a sacrifice for sin in order to buy back for you everything that
Adam lost. He came to destroy all the works of the devil...sickness and disease
included. Once you receive Him as Lord of your life, all the rights and
privileges God originally intended you to have (the right to things like
fellowship with God, health and prosperity) are restored.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But you are the one who has to
exercise those rights!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You see, the devil is an outlaw
and even though Jesus has taken away his authority in the earth, even though he
has no legal right to kill or steal from the children of God, he'll do it
anyway...as long as you'll let him get away with it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.35pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>You must enforce his defeat by speaking the Word of God in
faith. Act on His Word now. Demand that sickness and disease leave you in the
Name of Jesus. Then refuse to back off that demand. Resist the devil with all
you've got. He might fight you for a while, but sooner or later, he will have
to flee from you! <b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>Matthew 8:1-17</b></p>
