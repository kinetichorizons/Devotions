<h1>His Still Small Voice </h1>

line-height:99%'>But the anointing which ye have received of [God] abides in
you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches
you of all things, and is truth. 1 John 2:27</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Have you ever noticed that you are
sometimes aware of certain things even before you know what the Word says about
them? That's because the Holy Spirit is inside you teaching you the truth. He
speaks into your spirit. Then your spirit relays His promptings to your mind.
Suddenly, you'll have a new thought. &quot;I need to forgive that person,&quot;
you'll think, or &quot;I need to stop saying those unkind things.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As you become more aware of the
Spirit of God in your everyday affairs, you'll be quicker to hear and obey
those promptings. You'll actually get in the habit of allowing the Spirit of
Truth to reveal the will of God to you. And, believe me, that's one habit God
wants you to have!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>One of the first things that the
Spirit said to me when I began to listen to His promptings was &quot;spend more
time in prayer.&quot; As I obeyed, I began to be impressed to spend at least
one hour a day in prayer. After I'd begun to do that, He revealed it to me in
His Word (Matt. 26:40).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Since then, I have talked with
people from all over the world who are hearing the same thing. Believers
everywhere are hearing the Spirit of God direct them to more prayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God hasn't given the Holy Spirit
to just a few special Christians. He's given Him to all of us. And if we'll
just learn to be sensitive to His voice, He'll guide us into all truth!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Think about how different your
life would be if you knew the truth of God about every situation! Doesn't that
just make you want to listen to your spirit? Doesn't it make you want to be on
the keen edge of what God is saying?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Start tuning your ear to His
still small voice within you. Honor Him and welcome His guidance into your
everyday affairs. Listen for His promptings and be quick to obey. He's ready to
speak to you.</p>
