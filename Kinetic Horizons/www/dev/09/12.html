patience wait for it. </i>Romans 8:24-25</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>According to Romans, hope is
actually looking at something that you can't see. How do you do that? You do it
by looking at the promises of God in the Word until with your inner eyes--the
eyes of your spirit--a picture is formed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>For example, one of the hardest
things I ever had to do was face the fact that the inner image I had of myself
physically was fat. It didn't matter how hard I tried to change, it wouldn't go
away. I was always on a <a
href="http://www.kcm.org/index.php?p=daily_devotional&amp;devo_choices=FTHTOFTH&amp;devo_language=ENG&amp;devo_topic=&amp;date=2012-09-12"><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>diet.</span></a> I must have lost (and
regained) hundreds of pounds over the years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I finally had to admit that as
long as my inner image of myself was fat, my outer self was going to match it.
Remember, it's faith that changes things, and without the inner image of hope,
faith cannot work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So I decided to fast for seven
days. I searched my Bible for every scripture I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>could find on food and eating and
I found many.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I meditated on every one of those
scriptures and prayed in the Spirit for seven full days. What was I doing? I
was laying hold on a different inner image.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>This is not something you can do
overnight. It takes time. Especially if the inner image you're changing has
been there for years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But you can do it. Go to the Word
of God today and begin to change the images inside you. Change them from images
of despair to images of hope. Get a blueprint in your heart and your faith will
build on it!</p>
