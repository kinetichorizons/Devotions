<h1>Real Intercession </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:105%'>And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was
no intercessor. Isaiah 59:16</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When somebody hurts us, our
natural human reaction is to strike back...to ask God to clobber them. But
that's not God's way. I realized that one time when some relatives of mine got
robbed. I was praying about the situation and puzzling over it. &quot;Lord,&quot;
I began to ask, &quot;why did You let that happen? Why didn't You just knock
that thief over the head when he tried to do that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Suddenly, God enabled me to back
up from that situation and look at it with spiritual, instead of just purely
natural eyes. When I did that, I knew the answer to my question almost as
quickly as I had asked it. It was because of His mercy. God has great, great
mercy. Not just for me and my family but for theirs too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Think about that next time
someone does you wrong. Instead of asking God to knock that person in the head,
like I did, consider the fact that--as ornery as he may be--he may well have a
grandmother somewhere who's praying for him to be saved. Stop and remember that
God loved him enough to die for him, that He's longing to pardon--not punish
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Then you can begin to pray for
him instead of against him, uniting yourself with his grandmother (or anybody
else who happens to be praying for him). You can go to the Lord for mercy for
him and you can go up against the devil on his behalf. That's real intercession
and it throws the forces of darkness into total confusion. They have absolutely
no defense against it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Lord is looking for people
who are bold enough, committed enough to do that. Dare to be one of them. When
you're tempted to clobber somebody, dare to change his life instead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.7pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>Luke
6:27-36</b></p>
