<h1>Take Correction </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'>Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate you; reprove a wise man,
and he will love you. Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser;
teach a righteous man...and he will increase in learning. Proverbs 9:8-9</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>There is one thing you can do
that will accelerate your spiritual growth more than almost any other thing:
learn to take correction--from the Spirit of God and from His people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So few believers seem to be able
to do that. When their preacher gets in the pulpit and preaches about something
they already know, about some aspect of life they've already submitted to the
Lord, they think he's great. They like him because he makes them feel good. But
the moment he stands up and begins to preach about something they're doing
wrong, they take offense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God says that's foolish. He says,
in Proverbs 1:7, only fools strike out at, or despise, correction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So don't be like that. When your
pastor or anyone else in the Body of Christ has a word of correction for you, receive
it gratefully. Appreciate those who share the wisdom of God with you. When
someone points out somewhere that you've missed it, instead of reacting against
them, examine yourself and say, &quot;Is that right? Does that agree with the
Word? Do I need to make a change there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If the answer to those questions
is yes, then make the changes you need to make to get your life in line.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I know that's not easy. None of
us likes to be corrected. But if you'll make up your mind you're going to
receive that correction anyway, that you're going to remain teachable, you'll
be able to go on and grow in spiritual things much more quickly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>One man said, &quot;If you think
you've already arrived, you aren't going anywhere.&quot; Remember that next
time someone corrects you. Love that person and thank him for speeding along
your spiritual progress. If you'll do that, you'll come out ahead every time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.7pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>Proverbs
3:11-24</b></p>
