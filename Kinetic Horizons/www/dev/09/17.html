<h1>Be Courageous </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>Be thou strong and very courageous, that
you may observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant
commanded thee: turn not from it to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.05in;
margin-bottom:12.25pt;margin-left:.5pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>right
hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go. Joshua 1:7</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Living a life of faith takes
courage. Most people don't realize it, but it does! It takes courage to stand
up in the face of sickness and declare you're healed by the stripes of Jesus.
It takes courage to believe for prosperity and put your last dime in the
offering plate when poverty is staring you in the face. There are going to be
some days when you'd rather pull the covers over your head and hide than take
another faith stand against the devil. But you can't. Because the battle of
faith isn't fought once and then forgotten. If you want to keep living in
victory, you have to fight it again and again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>There's no way around it. Of
course, some of God's people still try to find one. The Israelites, for
example. They thought their battles should be over when they crossed the Red
Sea. So when they heard reports of giants living in the Promised Land, they
decided they couldn't face the fight. Their courage failed them. So they took a
40-year detour through the wilderness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But you know what? They still
couldn't avoid that fight. When the time came for the next generation to enter
the Promised Land, the giants were still there!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>This time, however, they found
the courage to face them. Where did they find it? In the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Their leader, Joshua, had obeyed
the instruction of the Lord and kept that Word on his mind and in his heart day
and night. He'd meditated on it and let it constantly remind him that God was
on their side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you're going to fight the good
fight of faith to the finish, you'll have to do just like Joshua did. You'll
have to continually draw courage from the Word of God. So make up your mind to
do it. Get into that Word and let it change you from a coward to an overcomer.
Then march into battle and slay the giants in your land.</p>
