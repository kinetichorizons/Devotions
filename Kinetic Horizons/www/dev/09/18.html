<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Man is something really special.
He is made in the image of God. He is made to have fellowship with God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Some people get the idea that God
made man so He'd have someone to dominate. But God is not a dominator. God is
love and love needs to give to someone. That's why God made man. He made him so
He could give him His love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God could have given His love to
the angels, and He did that. But giving to angels didn't provide total
fulfillment. Why? Because angels aren't made in His image.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You're the same way. Let's say,
for example, you have a puppy as a pet. You can fellowship with that little pet
just so much, but then there comes a time when you need to talk to somebody.
There comes a time when you need to have communication on your own level.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The reason you're like that is
because you're created in the image of God. That's how He is. He has a desire
to fellowship with someone like Himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Dare to believe you're something
really special today--a one-of-akind creation made by God in His very own
image. Dare to receive His love and dare to love Him back!</p>
