<h1>A Word About Angels </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-left:4.35pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
text-indent:0in;line-height:106%'><i>For he shall give his angels charge over
thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. </i>Psalm 91:11</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It's time to set the record
straight. Angels are not kid stuff. They're not little fat babies with long
blonde hair and bows and arrows in their hands. Angels are big, strong
warriors. They are real. They are powerful. And, if you are a believer, they are
a vital part of your life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We see examples of what angels
can do all through the Bible. For instance, when the children of Israel were
fleeing from Egypt with Pharaoh's army hot on their heels, the Bible tells us
that suddenly the wheels on the Egyptians' chariots got fouled up. They just
quit rolling!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Who do you think caused that? The
angels, of course!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>They haven't retired since then
either. Angels are at work today just as they've always been.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>A few years ago in one of
Israel's major wars, the enemy had their guns trained on Israeli cities. Those
guns were the finest military equipment <a

range of at least 20 miles and were equipped with electronic gun sights for
accuracy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But something very odd happened.
Every time they fired those guns at the Israelis, they either overshot or fell
far short of their targets. We know there was nothing wrong with the guns
because later the Israelis captured them and fired them back at the enemy with
perfect success.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What happened? Angels, that's
what!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>My friend, that isn't just a
fairy tale. That's a real-life example of the involvement of angels in the
lives of God's people today. And, if you're a child of God, then you have a
right to expect God's angels to do the same kind of things for you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So, start expecting! Say,
&quot;Thank You, heavenly Father for giving Your angels charge over me to keep
me in all my ways.&quot; Once you've spoken that word of faith, stand fast.
Don't fear. Don't waver. Just be patient and keep believing, and you will
surely see the salvation of the Lord.</p>
