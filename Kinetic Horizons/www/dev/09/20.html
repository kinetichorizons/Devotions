<h1>Time to Get Serious </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.85pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:normal'>O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee.... I [will]
remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches. Psalm
63:1,6</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you're going to live in divine
health, there are going to be times when you'll have to be downright extreme
about the Word of God. Times when you may be facing a sickness so severe that
you need more than just a few moments in the Word and a quick prayer to receive
your healing. I want to tell you, in very practical terms, what I would do in a
situation like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The moment I woke up in the
morning, before I did anything else, I'd take Communion. I'd say, &quot;Lord, I
dedicate my body all day today to the service of my Lord Jesus Christ. I take
Jesus' pure blood shed for me.&quot; Then I'd put the devil in his place. I'd
say, &quot;I rebuke you, Satan. You're not going to put any sickness and
disease on me today. Regardless of the symptoms, regardless of what my body
thinks about it, by the power of Jesus through His Spirit, I have overcome this
sickness because He that is within me is greater than he that is in the
world.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Then, all day long, I'd thank God
for my healing. I'd choose some teaching tapes that would fill my mind and my
spirit with the anointed Word of God, and I'd listen to them throughout the
day. In the afternoon, I'd praise God and receive Communion again to remind
myself that the blood of Jesus is in my veins, that I'm part of God's family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You don't have to wait until the
second Sunday of each month or whatever to receive Communion. Jesus just said,
&quot;As often as you do this, do it in remembrance of Me.&quot; And if you're
facing a serious attack of the devil, you need to remember Him all day and all
night. You need to consider Jesus until thoughts of Him push the thoughts of
that sickness right out of your mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That night before bed I'd receive
Communion again, then I'd praise myself to sleep. If I woke up in the night,
I'd reach over and get my Bible and read all the healing scriptures and make
the devil sorry he woke me. When the devil launches a serious attack against
your body, don't mess around. Get serious about the Word. Put yourself under
its constant care and it will take good care of you.</p>
