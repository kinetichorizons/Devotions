man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ. Ephesians
4:11-13</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Till we all come in the unity of
the faith. What this scripture means is simply this: If we're ever going to
become truly powerful in the kingdom of God, if we're ever going to be any
great threat to the devil, we're going to have to grow up-together. It won't be
enough for just a few of us to grow up on our own and say, &quot;Too bad&quot;
about everybody else. It doesn't work that way. We're a part of each other. The
Bible calls us one body...the Body of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Let me give you an example. When
I began teaching God's revelation on the laws of prosperity, I started getting
incredible flack. Preachers started calling me and chewing me out because I
wouldn't borrow money and things like that. Finally God said to me one day in
prayer, &quot;Don't teach on the laws of prosperity any more until I tell you
to.&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;There's strife in the
camp,&quot; He told me. &quot;Other preachers are mad at you and in strife over
it.&quot; I didn't realize then that the level where we stopped would affect us
all. I didn't realize that even I wouldn't be able to go on and operate in the
additional laws of prosperity until the rest of the Body would go with me.
We're not islands unto ourselves. I can't do anything without affecting you.
You can't do anything without affecting me. We're joined together by God but
held together by one another (Eph. 4:16). We can only grow up...together!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Learn to walk in love. Refuse to
fall prey to division and isolation. Feed on the Word daily and encourage your
brothers and sisters by feeding it to them too, so we can all grow up to be
&quot;a perfect [or mature] man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness
of Christ.&quot;</p>
