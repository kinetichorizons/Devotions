<h1>A Little Every Day </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.9pt;margin-left:.35pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:normal'>Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I
resemble it? It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast
into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air
lodged in the branches of it. Luke 13:18-19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you're going to grow in the
kingdom of God, you're going to do it just like a seed that's been planted in
the ground. How does a seed grow? All at once? No, it grows constantly-- 24
hours a day--a little all the time until it accomplishes what it was created to
do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Many of us don't operate that way
spiritually. We study and pray very hard for a few days and then quit. Then,
when some disaster comes, we make a mad attempt to pray and stand on the Word,
all the while realizing that, for some reason, we're just not as strong as we ought
to be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>There's no such thing as an
overnight success in the kingdom of God! Real strength, real growth comes as
you consistently and constantly keep the Word before your eyes, in your ears,
and in the midst of your heart. Not just when you want to or when you feel like
it, but constantly, like the seed, a little all the time. A man came up to me
once and said, &quot;Man, your ministry just took off overnight, didn't
it?&quot; &quot;If it did,&quot; I answered, &quot;it was certainly the longest
night I ever spent in my life!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>From his perspective my success
did seem to spring up quickly. That's because he didn't see me during all those
hours and weeks and months and years I spent in the Word of God. He didn't see
the daily process that lay behind that success. He just saw the results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.55pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Make up your mind to begin that daily process of constant
growth today. Determine to start putting the Word in your heart consistently.
Every day a line here, a line there--a tape here, a tape there. Begin to act as
though that Word is true every hour of the day regardless of what comes or how
you feel. Keep adding to your faith, meditating on it, confessing it, seven
days a week. Eventually, your faith will be bigger than you ever dreamed it
could be. <b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>Luke 13:18-21</b></p>
