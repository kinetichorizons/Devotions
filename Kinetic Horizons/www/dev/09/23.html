4:8</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Remember when you first got into
the Word and were so excited about the things of God? Remember when you could
hardly wait to read the next chapter in the Bible or listen to the latest
teaching tape? There was only one word to describe you-- HOT! Your reborn
spirit was on fire for God. When Ken and I first heard the message of faith, we
were like that. We were so on fire that nothing else in the world interested us.
We had learned that we could trust God's Word just like we could trust the word
of a close friend, and we were hungry to find out everything He had promised us
in His Word. Back then, it seemed all I did was read God's Word. I read faith
books. I listened to tapes. I was dedicated. My total interest was the Word of
God. But slowly that changed. At first I didn't even realize it was happening.
Then the Holy Spirit went to work on me and showed me that I had grown
lukewarm. I had let the fire die down. I still read the Word, but I had lost my
enthusiasm. Maybe you've had this same experience. If so, I want to tell you
how to get the fire back. It worked for me and it will work for you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God's Word says to draw near to
Him and He will draw near to you. In order to do that you will have to first
drop the things that are stealing your time from reading the Word. Delight
yourself in His Word. Become diligent again. If you will give your attention to
the things of God, soon your desire for God will increase. Your desire will
follow your attention. The more you attend to something, the more your desire
is drawn to give attention to that thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I can show you that this is a
natural principle. If you play golf, you'll go for months at a time without
even thinking about it. Then one day you'll make time in your schedule to go to
the course and play a round or two. The next day you may want to play again.
Your desire gets stronger and stronger the more you play.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>This same thing will happen in
the spirit realm. Your soul's desire will follow whatever you spend your time
doing. Start building yourself up by praying in the Spirit. Believe and act on
everything God says to you. Before long that flicker that's been wavering in
your spirit will grow again into an all-consuming FIRE!</p>
