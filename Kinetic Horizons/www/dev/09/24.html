<h1>God's Will Is Liberty </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:7.3pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:138%'><i>Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the
Lord is, there is liberty. 2 Corinthians 3:17 </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Liberty. If you could put the
will of God into one word, that would be the word. God wants people to be free.
Free from sin, sickness, poverty, oppression and every other curse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That freedom is what Jesus came
to provide. He said, &quot;The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath
anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor...to heal the brokenhearted, to
preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to
set at liberty them that are bruised&quot; (Luke 4:18). That's what He trained
His disciples to do. And if you're a born-again believer, that's what He wants
you to do too!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Some people say, &quot;Well, I
don't know about that. That may not be God's will for today.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>But listen, the Bible says God never
changes. He hasn't changed His will for the earth. He doesn't do one thing
awhile and then go do another thing awhile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus' life was a perfect picture
of God's will 2,000 years ago-- and it still is! That's why He left
instructions for us to go and do the works that He did. That's why He sent the
Holy Spirit to empower us to do them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus still wants to do the will
of the Father here on earth--but He does it through us. He has to work with us
until we're willing to lay down our traditions and let Him do His thing. That's
what the early Church did. They started out with a bang because they did as
Jesus taught them. Everywhere they went people became free.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Let's pray for the Church of
today to deliver the liberty of God to the world. Let's quit questioning the
will of God and start carrying it out instead. He said the works that He did we
would do also and even greater works (John 14:12). It's time for us to take up
where Jesus left off and set the captives free!</p>
