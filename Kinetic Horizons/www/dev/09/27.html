<h1>Spiritual Armor for Spiritual War </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this
world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Ephesians 6:12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Unfortunately, most of us don't
know the first thing about fighting the kind of war in this scripture. For, as
Ephesians 6:10-12 says, it's not a battle of flesh and blood, but of the
spirit. Most believers are so earthly minded (or carnally minded) that they
never even realize the actual source of the enemy's attacks. They blame
circumstances and people. They waste their energy fighting natural conditions
instead of supernatural causes. We need to wake up to the warfare that's going
on in the heavenly realm!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We can get a glimpse of it in
Daniel 10:12-20. There, we find that Daniel had been fasting and praying for 21
days, awaiting a word from the Lord. Then, an angel appeared to him 21 days
later with the answer. What took him so long? He was fighting the enemy in the
heavens.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That confuses some people. They
say, &quot;Devils fighting in heaven? I thought God reigned in heaven!&quot;
What they don't understand is that the Bible teaches there are three different
areas called heaven:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:13.15pt;text-indent:-13.15pt'><span
style='line-height:107%'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></span>The
heaven where God resides.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:13.15pt;text-indent:-13.15pt'><span
style='line-height:107%'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></span>The
stellar heavens (what we call &quot;outer space&quot;).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:13.15pt;text-indent:-13.15pt'><span
style='line-height:107%'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></span>The
heavens around this earth (the atmosphere surrounding this planet).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>This last heaven is where
spiritual war takes place. (That's why Ephesians 2:2 calls Satan the prince of
the power of the air.) The air is where wicked spirits operate. From there,
they attempt to rule the nations assigned to them. And rule them they will
unless the prayers of God's people keep them from it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God has an army marching in this
land. If we band together, we can prevent the wickedness in high places from
ruling our nation. The time has come for us to pray. So, put on your full armor
and take your place in the ranks of the faithful in intercession for our
country and the nations of the world!</p>
