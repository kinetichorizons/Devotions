<h1>No Burden </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:105%'>For the [true] love of God is this, that we do His
commands--keep His ordinances and are mindful of His precepts and teaching. And
these orders of His are not irksome--burdensome, oppressive, or grievous. 1
John 5:3</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you know why the Word of God
and the orders God gives to you in your spirit are not burdensome or
oppressive? Because everything He tells you is for your good and for your
victory!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God knows what it takes to live
in victory in this present evil world. In fact, He's the only one Who knows.
The people of this world cannot tell you how to live victoriously. They don't
know how. But God does! He can make things work, even in the middle of
darkness, and if we'll follow His instructions, commands and precepts from His
Word, we can too!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Let me give you an example. One
commandment that God gave to us is to love one another and forgive one another
as He has forgiven us. This command is not grievous because it's the key to our
freedom. If you can walk in the love that's been shed abroad in your heart,
you'll have joy every day. But if you don't walk in this commandment of love,
somebody will get your joy before lunch! God knows that. So, He made a command
of love and forgiveness because love works! Without love, there won't be any
joy, and the joy of the Lord is our strength.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't resent God's teachings.
Don't consider His ways a burden to your lifestyle. Rejoice over them. Take
them gladly by the hand and let them lead you all the way to victory!</p>
