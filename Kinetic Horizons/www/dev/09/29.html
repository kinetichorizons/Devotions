<h1>Dare to Decide </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.05pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Be it according to thy word. Exodus 8:10<span
style='font-size:26.0pt;line-height:107%'></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I used to worry about making
decisions for God. I used to be afraid to step out on faith and declare I was
going to do something new that He'd shown me to do. I'd think, &quot;What if I fail?&quot;
I was so scared of failing, I'd muddle around in indecision for weeks. Then one
day I found out it wasn't my power that was going to carry it out anyway. But
it took my decision to move God in on the scene. Once I decided what I was
going to do and set it down firm, God backed me!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What I learned is a truth from
the Word of God that, if you'll pay attention to it, will revolutionize your
life. It's truth that carries an awesome responsibility with it, but it's a
wonderful thing to realize. Here it is: The right, the privilege, and the power
to DECIDE has been left by God in the hands of men.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>You have the right, for example, to
decide where you're going to spend eternity. You have a right to make that
decision, and God will back your decision. God can do everything for you but
decide. He's provided the power. He's provided</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>His Name. He's provided the blood
of Jesus. He's provided the kingdom of God. He's even made us partakers of it
(Col. 1:12). But He's not going to stuff that inheritance down our throats.
Somewhere down the line we each have to make the decision to receive it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Now the beautiful part is this:
When you make that decision, God will back you to the hilt with His power. Once
you make a decision to be born again, there's no devil in hell big enough to
stop you. All you have to do is decide. Decide now. Declare your decision. Let
it be done unto you according to your words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Is God leading you in some new
direction? Is He leading you to step out in faith for healing or prosperity or
to take a whole new step of ministry? Don't let fear hold you back.</p>
