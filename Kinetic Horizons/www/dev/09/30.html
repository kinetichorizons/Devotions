<h1>Compassion in Action </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

line-height:99%'>But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion
on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no
shepherd. Matthew 9:36</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Compassion. That's the one thing
people need more than anything else in this world. They need someone to reach
out to them with the compassion of God. Compassion is a deep yearning that
responds to the needs of people. It's much deeper than sympathy. Sympathy can
just sit around feeling sorry for people. Compassion has to do something for
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Compassion is what motivates God,
and Jesus' life on earth was a picture of that compassion in action. His whole
ministry was driven by it. It was compassion that caused Him to multiply the
loaves and fishes, heal the sick, cast out demons and raise the dead. It was
compassion that compelled Him to go to the Cross. And it's that same compassion
that He now longs to pour out through you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's a staggering thought,
isn't it? It's staggering to realize that we believers are the only body Jesus
has on this earth now. His healing must flow through our hands and our faith.
His compassion must move us to provide for the hungry. It must compel us to
cast out demons and set the captives free. &quot;But, Brother Copeland, I don't
have that kind of compassion!&quot; Yes, you do. If you have the Spirit of God
dwelling inside you, you do-- because He is that kind of love! You simply need
to activate it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>How? Just like Jesus did when He
walked the earth. Through prayer and fellowship with the Father. Look through
the Gospels and notice how much time Jesus spent alone with the Father. That
time activated the compassion of God within Him. It caused Him to feel what God
feels about the suffering of mankind. It stirred Him so much that whenever He
encountered a need, He met it by the power of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Follow His example. Spend time in
fellowship with your Father. Meditate on His compassion until it rises up
strong on the inside of you. Stir it up until the desire to see others set free
becomes paramount in your thinking. Jesus has sent you to reach out and touch a
love-starved world with His compassion. If you don't do it, who will?</p>
