line-height:99%'>By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name. Hebrews
13:15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Great things happen when you
continually confess the mercy of God. Faith rises up on the inside of you. The
reality that God loves you begins to sing through your spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What's more, it brings honor to
your Father when you believe His Word and magnify His love and mercy. You honor
Him when you speak of His goodness and loving-kindness, when you talk about Him
as your Father of love Who does only good. It blesses Him when you praise Him
as the great God of the universe who is eager to bless and Who even gave His
own Son because He so loved the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>David was a man after God's own
heart. He knew how to praise his God. Until you have the Word dwelling in you
richly so that you can speak psalms and praises out of your own spirit, use the
praises of David to magnify God. Speak them or sing them out loud to the
Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Put His words continually on your
lips. You will soon begin to experience the thrill and the joy of realizing
that God is indeed &quot;rich in mercy&quot; because of His great love with
which He loved us. Your faith will rise to new heights and your Father will be
blessed! And you will be blessed.</p>
