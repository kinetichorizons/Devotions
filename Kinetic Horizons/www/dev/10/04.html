mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. Matthew 18:16 </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You've been there many times,
standing in the valley of decision Perched precariously between victory and
defeat. On one side of you is the word of the world authored by Satan that
says, for example, &quot;You're not going to get healed.&quot; On the other
side of you, the Word of God is saying, &quot;My Word is Yea and Amen&quot; and
&quot;By His stripes, ye were healed.&quot; Who will determine how it all turns
out? You will. You're the establishing witness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I remember a fellow once who
wanted me to pray for him. I said, &quot;Now the Word says you're healed.&quot;
He interrupted me and said, &quot;Yeah, I know it says that, but I've got this
terrible pain here....&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I looked him in the eye and said
again, &quot;The Word says, 'By His stripes, you were healed.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;I know it,&quot; he
answered, &quot;but I've got this terrible....&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I shook my head. &quot;Listen,
the Word says you're healed!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He turned beet red. &quot;I KNOW
IT SAYS THAT, BUT I'VE GOT THIS....&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Finally, he stopped and stared at
me. He didn't realize it, but he'd allowed his physical symptoms to become his
evidence. It was what he believed. No matter what the Word said, he believed
the thing he could see and feel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But when he got quiet, I said to
him, &quot;Look, you're wanting me to<a

because I won't. But if I agree with you, you're going to die. Now if you'll
agree with me and the Bible, we can get you healed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Suddenly he saw it. His eyes lit
up. &quot;Oh, praise God! I see what you mean. I agree with the Word of
God!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I put my hands on his head and
God healed him instantly.</p>
