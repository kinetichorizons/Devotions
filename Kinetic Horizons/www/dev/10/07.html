<h1>Leave Foolishness Behind </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:11.65pt;margin-left:5.0pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'>Evil pursues sinners: but to the righteous good shall be
repaid. Proverbs 13:21</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Satan has had us in a poverty
mentality so long that it's tough for us to grasp just how intensely God really
does desire to prosper us--even though He's demonstrated that desire again and
again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Take Abraham, for example. God
made him an extremely wealthy man. Genesis 13:2 says he was rich in cattle, in
silver and in gold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Then, of course, there was
Solomon. The Bible says he surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and
wisdom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God's servant Job possessed such
great wealth that he was called the greatest of all the men of the East. That
was before Satan put him through the wringer. Afterward, God blessed him with
more than twice what Satan had stolen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The problem is, just the thought
of the kind of wealth God gave to those men scares most believers today.
They're afraid it would destroy them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God has said that &quot;the
prosperity of fools shall destroy them&quot; (Prov. 1:32).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But that doesn't mean you should
avoid being prosperous. It means you should avoid being a fool!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I challenge you, this week, to go
to Proverbs and find out for yourself what God says about the characteristics
of a fool. Let the Holy Spirit search your heart. If you see ways in which
you've been a fool, repent and make a firm decision not to be caught in that
trap again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Let the Word of God inspire you
to leave foolishness behind and stir within you the faith to reach out and
receive what you, as a redeemed child of the living God, have a divine right
to--not the curse of poverty, but the blessing of prosperity!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.7pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>Genesis
15:1-6</b></p>
