<h1>Prepare for Persecution </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:105%'>Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall
suffer persecution. 2 Timothy 3:12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Did you catch that? He said all who live godly lives are
going to suffer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>persecution. Not just the
super-saints, not just the missionaries in hostile lands--but ALL. If you're
going to live for God, you're going to run into persecution somewhere along the
line. The devil's going to make sure of it! Now I'm not saying that to frighten
you or to depress you. I'm saying it because I want you to be prepared. When
you're wise to the strategies of the devil, it's harder for him to use them
successfully on you to confuse you and get you off track.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Second Corinthians 10:4 says,
&quot;For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to
the pulling down of strongholds.&quot; So stay armed and ready for Satan's
attack. Then, whenever and however it comes, it won't bring your life to a halt
or even slow you down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's especially important right
now because we're living in the last days. The devil's time is drawing short.
He is desperate. He is going to do everything he can to stop the Church. But
Jesus said the gates of hell would not prevail against His Church!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Remember the more we grow to be
like Jesus and the more God's glory is revealed through our lives, the bigger
threat we are to Satan's kingdom. Jesus said, &quot;Rejoice and be glad at such
a time, and exult and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is rich and great
and strong and intense and abundant in heaven&quot; (Luke 6:23, The Amplified
Bible).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.65pt;margin-bottom:
7.05pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:132%'>So, when persecution comes your
way, and you know it will, rejoice and be glad. Take the Jesus cure and begin
to leap and jump and praise God! There is no way persecution will hurt you if
you do that. I've tried it and it works. <b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>Acts
6:1-15</b></p>
