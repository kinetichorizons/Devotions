<h1>From Religion to Reality </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.85pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:normal'>For [God] hath made [Jesus] to be sin for us, who knew no
sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. 2 Corinthians 5:21</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When you were born again, you
weren't half-reborn, you weren't made halfrighteous or a quarter righteous. You
were made the righteousness of God in Christ! You were made a &quot;joint-heir
with Him.&quot; According to Strong's Concordance that word joint-heir refers
to a personal equality based on an equality of possession.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus went to the Cross to give
you what He already possessed. He rose again so you could be recreated in His
image. You are the victory of Almighty God! You are more than a conqueror in
Christ Jesus. You are everything to the Father that Jesus is. John 17:23 actually
says that God loves you as much as He loves Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Once you dare to accept that
fact, your life will forever be changed. You'll no longer be satisfied to just
sit around whining and wishing things were different. You'll want to step up to
the position of authority that Jesus has given you, to take your rightful place
beside Him and learn to operate the way He does. As His people, we are
everything to God that Jesus is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.05pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:146%'>If you'll receive that message, if you'll
dare to believe it, if you'll dare to put it into action, it will radically
alter your life. It will take you from religion to reality! <b>Scripture
Reading:</b> <b>John 17:16-26</b></p>
