<h1>That Glorious Name </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'>And I will do--I Myself will grant--whatever you may ask in My
name [presenting all I AM] so that the Father may be glorified and extolled in
[through] the Son. John 14:13</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In Jesus' Name. It's more than a
phrase we tack onto the end of our prayers. All that God is and does is
represented in the Name of Jesus. The Amplified Bible says when you ask in His
Name, you present your requests to the Father on the basis of all that Jesus
is. So you can boldly expect to have those requests granted--not because you're
worthy, but because He is!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>What's more, the Name of Jesus carries authority over all
other names. In</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Philippians 2:5-11, the Apostle Paul tells us, &quot;God
also hath highly exalted him</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>[Jesus], and given him a name which
is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things
in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In spite of all the Word of God
has to say about the power of the Name of Jesus, most believers don't seem to put
much stock in it. They'll pray in the Name of Jesus, then turn right around and
say, &quot;I sure hope God answers that prayer.&quot; They don't realize that
if they only had the faith to believe it, Jesus' Name alone carries enough
clout to guarantee their prayers will be answered. They even let religious
slang rob them of the power of using that Name. I've heard many a well-meaning
believer end his prayer with the phrase, &quot;For Jesus' sake.&quot; But Jesus
didn't say to pray for His sake. He said to pray in His Name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I used to make that mistake
myself. One night I was praying because I was suffering from a stomachache.
&quot;Oh, for Jesus' sake,&quot; I prayed, &quot;heal my stomach.&quot; After
I'd said that a few times, the Lord spoke up on the inside of me. &quot;Wait a
minute,&quot; He said, &quot;whose stomach is hurting here, Mine or
yours?&quot; &quot;Mine!&quot; I answered. Then He very plainly said, &quot;In
that case, pray for your stomach's sake, in My Name!&quot; Jesus' Name. Dig
into the Word and find out just how much power and authority it really carries.
Then use that power every time you pray. Stop hoping God will answer and start
expecting Him to cause every circumstance in your life to bow its knee in honor
of that glorious Name!</p>
