<h1>The Heart of the King </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:105%'>The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of
water: he turns it wherever he will. Proverbs 21:1</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Think about that for a moment!
God has reserved the right to override the will of a nation's leader, if need
be, to see that His people are governed according to His will. What's more, God
will hear the prayer of any government leader. Even if he's the worst reprobate
in the whole world. He heard the prayer of old King Nebuchadnezzar. Believe me,
that means He'll listen to any leader!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You see, Nebuchadnezzar was king
of Babylon. He was an ungodly ruler of an ungodly nation. However, he'd taken
captives from the land of Judah. He had some of God's people under his
authority. So, God began to deal with him. Again and again, God warned him,
&quot;Nebuchadnezzar, you're going to lose your mind if you don't straighten
up.&quot; And, sure enough, he went just as crazy as could be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He stayed that way for years too.
Then one day he cried out to God and God heard him. Despite his status as a
heathen king of a heathen nation, God intervened repeatedly in Nebuchadnezzar's
life and heard him when he finally cried out for help. Why? Because he had
God's people under his rule! That same principle still holds true today. If
we'll open the way through prayer, God will deal with our leaders!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If we will humble ourselves in
unity and pray, God can change the injustice and corruption that exist in our
country, or any country for that matter. He'll change the hearts of everyone
from the White House on down to make sure His children are governed justly.
Make it a point to pray for our leaders today!</p>
