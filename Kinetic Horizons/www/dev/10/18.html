<h1>From Tradition to Truth </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not
all his benefits: Who forgives all your iniquities; who heals all thy diseases;
Who redeems thy life from destruction; who crowns thee with loving kindness and
tender mercies; Who satisfies thy mouth</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-2.1pt;
margin-bottom:12.15pt;margin-left:.5pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>with
good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's. Psalm 103:2-5</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Is there actually a divine
purpose behind the bad things that happen in your life? Could it be that the
sicknesses and calamities you experience are somehow a part of God's plan for
you?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Before you can ever begin to
experience the healing, delivering power of God, you've got to know the answer
to those questions. You have to settle them once and for all. If you even
suspect that God is the source of your misfortunes, you won't be able to believe
Him for deliverance from them. Your faith will be crippled because you'll think
that by escaping those things, you'll be opposing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>His will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In order to receive all the
benefits God desires to give you, you must be absolutely sure that He is a good
God. You must be certain that His will for you is health, not sickness;
prosperity, not poverty; happiness, not sorrow-- 100 percent of the time! Psalm
103 alone is enough to prove that's true. But if it's not enough to convince
you, there are many others too. One of the best known verses is Psalm 136:1
that says, &quot;O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his mercy
endureth for ever.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If religious traditions have
robbed you of the goodness of God, if it's taught you He brings trouble into
your life so He can teach you something, start today washing those traditions
away with the truth. Get out your Bible and let God Himself tell you through
His own Word that He is the God that heals you (Exod. 15:26). Dig into the
Scriptures and discover for yourself that He is a God of mercy (Ps. 86:5),
loving-kindness (Jer. 9:24), and compassion (Ps. 145:8).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Put your doubts to rest and open
your heart to receive the truth about your heavenly Father. It's the only thing
that can truly set you free.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.7pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>Psalm
89:1-28</b></p>
