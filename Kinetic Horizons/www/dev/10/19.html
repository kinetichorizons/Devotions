<h1>Don't Let Division Stunt Your Growth </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> And I, brethren, could not speak
unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. I
have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to
bear it, neither yet now are ye able. For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there
is among you envying, and strife, and divisions.... 1 Corinthians 3:1-3</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Envying, strife and divisions had
reduced the early Corinthian Christians back to the natural, or carnal, state that
they were in before they were born again. It had so stunted their spiritual
growth that they couldn't understand the things the Apostle Paul wanted to
teach them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Satan has sent the same spirit of
division among us today. He knows that a house divided against itself will
fall. He also knows if we all come together in the unity of our faith, we'll
arrive at the full stature of Christ Jesus (Eph. 4:13). So he has assigned a
spirit of division to operate in our personal lives, our church lives, our social
lives and our family lives. His goal is the same as it was in Corinth: To bring
envying, strife, division and to stunt our spiritual growth. But we don't have
to yield to that spirit. Instead Paul says, &quot;[by] speaking the truth in
love, [we] may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even
Christ.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Compare &quot;speaking the truth in love&quot; to
&quot;envyings, strife, and divisions.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Diametrical opposites, aren't
they? You can't do both of them at the same time. As you speak the truth in
love, you grow up. As you envy, fuss and separate from one another, you go back
to babyhood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't let Satan stop your
spiritual growth by giving in to the spirit of division but speak the truth in
love and &quot;grow up into Him in all things!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.75pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>James
