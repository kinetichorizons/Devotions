For whoever wants to save his [higher...] life, will lose [it]...and whoever
gives up his life for My sake and the Gospel's, will save [it]. Mark 8:34-35</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When Jesus said those words, He
wasn't just giving us a prescription for getting to heaven. He was telling us
how to live a superior life right here on earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You see, there's a high life that
we can live right here, right now. But to get in on it, we have to lay down the
way of life that most of us are accustomed to. We may have to let go of the very
things we've been trying so hard to latch onto. We have to set our hearts
instead on doing what God wants us to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's what Jesus did. He didn't
live His life for Himself. He lived it completely for God. He did only what the
Father told Him to do--and He lived in total victory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It's time to realize that getting
born again is not something we do just to miss hell. Our purpose is to please
God. To lay down our lives in order to fulfill His desires. To be His special
possessions in the earth and to do whatever He tells us to do. Our top priority
is to give ourselves to Him and to live in communion with Him. To spend enough
time with Him that we can hear His voice and respond in obedience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Only when we do that will we be
genuinely fulfilled. Only when we do that will we be able to live the high life
we've been longing for.</p>
