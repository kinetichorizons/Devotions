<h1>Covenant Prosperity </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.85pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:normal'>But you shall remember the Lord thy God: for it is he that
gives you power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant. Deuteronomy
8:18</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What is God's reason for
prospering His people? Is it so we can watch bigger TVs? So we can buy finer
houses and more luxurious cars? Establishing God's covenant on the earth and
giving to those in need: Those are God's purposes for prosperity!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I've had some people tell me,
&quot;Well, Brother Copeland, Jesus' ministry was poor and He got along just
fine.&quot; That's ridiculous. All the way through the Old Testament God
promised material blessings to anyone who would walk perfectly and uprightly
before Him. If God had failed to bless Jesus financially, He would have been
breaking His own Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus never built a worldly
empire for Himself. But that doesn't mean He was poor. It means He was the
greatest giver Who ever walked the face of this earth--and it's about time we
started following in His footsteps. If we'll start giving, if we'll start
taking care of the needs in people's pocketbooks, we'll be far more likely to
win their hearts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What do you think will happen to
the heart of a starving nation when you bring in a 747 full of food, clothes
and medical supplies to them in the Name of Jesus and His love? The hearts of
those people are going to soften! They're going to be willing to listen to what
we have to say about Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't you ever let anyone tell you
it's wrong to want to prosper. It's wrong for you not to want to prosper when
that prosperity can mean the difference between heaven and hell for millions of
people. Forget about your own little needs. Raise your vision and set your mind
on giving to meet someone else's, on establishing God's covenant in the earth.
Then stand fast in faith and get ready to enjoy the greatest prosperity you've
ever known.</p>
