<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>There are times when life on this
earth is hard and uncomfortable...and even downright painful. When those times
come, you deeply need the comfort that only the Holy Spirit can bring. How do
you receive that kind of comfort? By doing just what the believers in Acts did.
By &quot;walking in the fear of the Lord.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Now, when I talk about &quot;the
fear of the Lord,&quot; please understand, I'm not saying you should be afraid
of God. He's your Father! You should be as secure and unafraid when you come
before Him as a child who knows he is dearly loved. But you must also have so
much respect for Him that whenever He reveals something you need to do, you do
it immediately-- even if it goes against your natural desires. That's walking
in the fear of the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Let me show you what I mean.
Once, several years ago, I received a very disturbing phone call shortly before
I was to preach at one of our meetings. It was painful news about a situation
in which one of my children had been wronged. The news of it wounded my heart.
I cried, and in the natural, I wanted to get angry about it, to strike back in
some way. But instead, I began praying in other tongues. As I prayed, I was
prompted in my spirit to rejoice and praise the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I certainly didn't feel like
praising. I felt like stomping my foot. But, out of respect to the Lord, I put
my feelings aside and obeyed. Next, the Holy Spirit impressed me to read a
particular prophecy. As I did, I could tell I was being strengthened. Then
suddenly, I realized I was free. By my obedience, I had opened myself to the
comforting power of the Holy Spirit. The anger and pain that had filled me just
moments before were gone! They had been replaced by the gentle love and
reassurance of the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>No matter how tough or painful a
situation you may be facing today, trust and obey the directions of your
Father. He will make that same supernatural, Holy Spirit-inspired comfort
available to you!</p>
