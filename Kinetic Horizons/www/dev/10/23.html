<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you were given the choice
between life and death, which would you choose? The answer seems obvious. But,
in reality, it's not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You see, choosing death doesn't
necessarily mean jumping from the nearest cliff. It's much more subtle than
that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Bible says death is being
carnally minded, being entangled in this present worldly realm. The Bible also
tells us what life is. &quot;My son, attend to my words,&quot; says Proverbs
4:20-22, &quot;...for they are life!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>To be worldly-minded is death. To
be Word-minded is life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In Luke 10, there's a story that
illustrates this principle extremely well. It's the story of Mary and Martha.
You probably remember it. Mary was sitting at Jesus' feet listening to Him
teach while Martha was bustling around in the kitchen cooking dinner for
everyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Finally Martha couldn't stand it
anymore. She came to Jesus and said, &quot;Lord, don't you care that my sister
has left me to do all the<a

me!&quot; Jesus answered, &quot;Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled
about many things: But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good
part, which shall not be taken away from her&quot; (Luke 10:4142).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Mary had set everything else
aside, so she could hear the Word. But Martha had let the seemingly important business
of living take priority over the Word. She'd chosen death, not life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You see how easy it is to slip
into that?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;But Brother Copeland,&quot;
you say, &quot;if I didn't spend all my time taking care of the business of
living, my life would fall apart!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Oh, really? Martha probably
thought that too. She probably thought if she didn't cook dinner for all those
folks, they'd go hungry. But they wouldn't have. Jesus had miraculously fed
multitudes before and He could have done it again in Martha's home. She could
have plopped herself down at Jesus' feet, and they could have had a banquet at
God's expense!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't make the mistake that
Martha did. Don't get so entangled in the business of living that you choose
death by default. Decide to put the Word first place. Choose life!</p>
