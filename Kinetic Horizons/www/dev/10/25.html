<h1>Get Rid of the Frogs </h1>

line-height:normal'>When shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and
for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses? Exodus 8:9</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Have you ever wrestled with one
of those problems that stubbornly refuses to go away? It seems to be immune to
all solutions. You swat at the thing in every conceivable way, but instead of
being eliminated, it expands and multiplies until it's wildly out of control.
An Egyptian pharaoh faced just that kind of problem, the Bible tells us, thousands
of years ago. He was in a hot dispute with God over the future of the
Israelites, and as a result of that dispute, he woke up one morning to find his
country swarming with frogs. Slimy, smelly, hopping-allover-the-place frogs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It was a serious problem. I'm not
talking about a frog or two in the front yard. I mean frogs were everywhere--in
their beds, on their tables. Big old frogs in the ovens. Little bitty frogs in
the bread dough and the drinking water. Frogs. Frogs in your hair. Frogs in
places you wouldn't even want to think about!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Then God made a move. He sent His
man Moses in to Pharaoh to ask, &quot;When shall I entreat the Lord to get
these frogs out of here?&quot; Do you know what Pharaoh said?
&quot;Tomorrow.&quot; Can you imagine that? He could have said, &quot;Right
now! Today!&quot; But instead he decided he'd spend one more night among the
frogs. You say, &quot;That's the stupidest thing I ever heard. Why in the world
would he do it tomorrow?&quot; I don't know. Probably for the same reason you
want to wait until tomorrow to get saved or healed or prosperous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Here's what I want you to notice.
When Moses asked Pharaoh that question and he answered, &quot;Tomorrow,&quot;
Moses said, &quot;All right. So that you know there's a God in heaven, BE IT
DONE UNTO YOU ACCORDING TO YOUR WORDS.&quot; Let me ask you this: How long are
you willing to let that persisting problem harass you? When are you going to
get rid of the frogs in your life? Do you realize they'll stay around as long
as you'll let them? They'll be there until you finally make a quality decision
to go with the Word of God and get them out. Why don't you do it today?</p>
