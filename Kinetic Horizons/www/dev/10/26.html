<h1>Take Your Place </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:normal'>But God, who is rich in mercy, for his
great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath
quickened us together with Christ...And hath</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:12.85pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:normal'>raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly
places in Christ Jesus. Ephesians 2:4-6</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God has raised us up to sit
together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus! That's what the Word of God says.
Very few of us have actually dared to believe this. We've uplifted Jesus. We've
exalted Him--and rightly so! But at the same time, we've unwittingly belittled
what He did by not allowing Him to bring us alongside Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That was God's purpose at
Calvary: to bring us alongside Jesus. To make us what He already was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You see, Jesus didn't need
exalting. He was exalted before He ever came to this earth. He was already one
with the Father. He didn't need to get authority over the devil--He'd never
lost it!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He put on a physical body so that
He could come to earth as a man and gain authority over sin and sickness,
demons, fear, poverty and all the other curses that came when the law of death
moved into the earth--and He did it. He succeeded. He mastered everything in
the world of the intellect, everything in the physical world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Before He ascended, He said,
&quot;All authority is given unto Me both in heaven and in the earth.&quot;
Then He turned around and gave that authority to us by giving us His Name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You and I are the reason Jesus
came to earth and died and lived again. He didn't do it for Himself. He did it
so He could bring us alongside. So we could wear His Name and wield His
authority on the earth. He did it so that we could stand before God and be
everything to Him that Jesus is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When you were born again, you
were made the righteousness of God in Christ! So as a born-again believer, dare
to receive this message, to meditate on it and to act on it. Go ahead--dare to
take your place!</p>
