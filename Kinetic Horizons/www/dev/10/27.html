<h1>Don't Depend on Guesswork </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:12.4pt;
margin-bottom:13.0pt;margin-left:28.25pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:-14.7pt;
line-height:99%'>Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show you great and
mighty things, which you know not.  Jeremiah 33:3</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Who do you turn to when you need
help, when you need an important answer to an important question? Do you ask
God first? So many believers fail to do that. They'll stand around wringing
their hands and talking to each other all day. They'll inquire of their pastor.
They'll inquire of their friends. They'll inquire of their husbands or wives.
But do they inquire of God? No. Don't make that mistake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Instead, follow the example of
King David. In 1 Chronicles 14, the Bible tells us he was about to face a
battle with the very powerful Philistines who had ALL come out against him. The
Philistine nation had been an enemy of Israel for years. David probably could
have guessed that God would tell him to go to battle against them. But he
didn't guess! He went to God and inquired, saying, &quot;Shall I go up against
the Philistines? And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the Lord said
unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't depend on guesswork. When
you encounter a problem, seek the Lord through the Word and in prayer and ask
Him what the solution is. No matter how much scripture you learn, no matter how
fully you perceive who you are in Christ Jesus, you'll never outgrow your need
to do that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Go to the Lord and find out
exactly what He wants you to do. Don't decide your course of action and then
ask God to bless your plans. Go to Him and say, &quot;Lord, what are Your
plans?&quot; His plans are already blessed. If you follow them, your victory is
guaranteed.</p>
