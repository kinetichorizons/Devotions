line-height:107%'>But faith...works by love. Galatians 5:6</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I used to wonder why we believers
didn't see more of the power of God operating among us than we do. With what we
know about faith and the Word, it seemed to me signs and wonders and miracles
should be happening all the time. So, one day I asked, &quot;Lord, why isn't
the power of God turned up to a higher volume in the Church?&quot; Do you know
what He said? He told me we weren't walking in enough love yet. God wants us to
have power. But first, He has to be sure we'll use that power in love. He wants
to know that we won't take it and mix it with judgment and criticism and blast
people out of the water. &quot;Kenneth,&quot; He said, &quot;I can't afford to
back your words with supernatural power in a church service on Sunday morning
and then have you get on the freeway that night and lash out at someone because
he pulled over into your lane. You'd blow him off the highway. I can't leave
the power of Almighty God at a high volume in the mouth of an unmerciful fool.&quot; 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Then He reminded me of a time I
took my son, John, hunting. He was just a little guy at the time, barely big
enough to keep his gun from knocking him on his back every time he'd pull the
trigger. I was teaching him how to shoot, and he was coming along pretty well.
That day we were walking along out at Gloria's grandparents' farm and John
spotted one of the biggest tarantula spiders I'd ever seen. It was clinging to
the wall of the barn. When John saw that spider, he took aim. He was going to
blow that bug away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If I hadn't stopped him, he would
have too. And it wouldn't have dawned on him until it was all over that he was
going to blow a hole in the barn at the same time. From my grown-up
perspective, I could see that would be foolishness. He couldn't. He was looking
through the eyes of a child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you want God to put a shotgun
of spiritual power in your hand, so you can blow the works of the devil to
kingdom come? Then focus on love. Pursue it. Practice it. Study it. Grow up in
it. Then you'll see the power of God operating through you.</p>
