<h1>He Opened the Way </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:5.55pt'>In the beginning [before all time] was the Word [Christ],
and the Word was with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.9pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'>God, and the Word was God Himself.... And the Word [Christ]
became flesh (human, incarnate) and tabernacled --fixed His tent of flesh,
lived awhile-among us.... John 1:1,14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The deity of the Lord Jesus
Christ is something that can never be brought into question by any born again
believer. Our very salvation rests on the fact that Jesus Christ is divine, the
second person of the Godhead, God--the Son. The beloved disciple and apostle,
John, forever puts to rest any doubt about that in John 1:1,14. Anyone who
doubts what those verses say could not possibly have been born of the kingdom
of God. For the deity of Jesus forms the very foundation of our faith in Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Yet, if you'll search the Gospels, you'll see that Jesus
didn't go around</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>proclaiming Himself as God during
His 33 years on earth. He acknowledged that He was the Son of God, the Messiah.
He referred to God as His Father (which enraged the Pharisees), but He never
made the assertion that He was the most high God. In fact, He told His
disciples that the Father God was greater and mightier than He (John 14:28).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The reason is simple. He hadn't
come to earth just as God. He'd come also as man. The Word says He set aside
His divine power and took the form of a human being--with all its limitations.
Since God was His Father, He was not born with the sin nature that had been
passed along to the sons of Adam. But by being born of a woman, in all other
respects He became a man and called Himself the Son of Man or, literally, the
Son of Adam.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>How, then, did He do all those
mighty works? The same way He expects us to do them today--by the anointing and
the power of the Holy Spirit (Acts 10:38). He said, &quot;It's the Father
within Me who does the work.&quot; What does that mean to you? It means that
Jesus meant exactly what He said when He said that you, as a believer, would be
able to do the works that He did! (John 14:12). It means that you, as a reborn
child of God, filled with the same Holy Spirit as Jesus was, have the
opportunity to live as He lived when He was on earth. In fact, that is exactly
what He intends. He went before you, as a man, and opened the way. Don't just
admire Him for it. Follow Him in it today!</p>
