<h1>An Experienced Champion </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'>But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength;
they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and
they shall walk, and not faint. Isaiah 40:31</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Did you know that the force of
faith has the power to rejuvenate your physical body? It's true. You can see
that in the life of Sarah. Most people don't understand the full extent of what
God did in her life. All they know is that He enabled her to have a child in
her old age.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But if you'll look closer, you'll
see that there was more to it than that. When Sarah laid hold of the promise of
God by faith, it began to restore her physically to such an extent that when
King Abimelech saw her, he wanted her for his wife.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Think about that! At 90 years
old, she was so beautiful that a king wanted her in his harem. What's more,
after she gave birth to Isaac, the Bible says, she nursed him till he was
weaned. Then she kept right on living until that boy was raised!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Now, I'm not telling you you can
have a baby at 90 like Sarah did. She had a specific promise from God about
that. But I am telling you that if you'll believe God for renewed strength and
health in your old age, He'll provide it for you. In fact, Psalm 103 says
that's one of His benefits. It says God will fill your mouth with good things
so your youth is renewed like the eagle's.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God's desire for you in your old
age is that you are a powerful, experienced champion of the Word with your
strength renewed by faith. Start confessing that today. Fill your mouth with
the promises of God. Say, &quot;Praise God, my youth is renewed like the
eagle's.&quot; You'll still go to heaven when your work on earth is
through--but you won't just fade away. You'll fly out of here in a blaze of
glory like the conqueror God created you to be.</p>
