<h1>It Only Takes a Few </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.6pt;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:2.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:103%'>If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble
themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then
will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.15pt;margin-left:2.25pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>2 Chronicles
7:14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You may be thinking, &quot;Can a
few people like us actually change the whole nation?&quot; Let me ask you this:
Can one demonic person change a nation for the worse? Definitely. Hitler did it
in Germany, didn't he? If the devil's power resting on a man can change a
nation for the worse, you can be sure that a group of men and women with God's
power resting on them can change a nation for the better.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>No nation is so far gone that God
can't change it. Israel proved that. Why, even when it didn't exist, the devil
couldn't destroy it. God raised it back up before His very eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I want you to notice something in
that scripture. It says, &quot;If MY people, which are called by MY
name....&quot; God didn't say it would take everybody in the nation to get
things turned around. He said, &quot;If MY people....&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Notice also that He didn't say,
&quot;If my people will get out there and sign petitions and drum up a majority
vote....&quot; He said, &quot;Pray.&quot; In other words, we're going to have
to quit trying to work this thing out by ourselves. God Himself will do the
healing in this land. Our job is to pray, to believe and to seek His face. Seek
Him today.</p>
