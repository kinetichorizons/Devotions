<h1>Fight the Right Foe </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>For though we walk in the flesh,
we do not war after the flesh. 2 Corinthians 10:3</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you know why so many believers
are losing the battles in their lives? They're fighting the wrong enemy!
They've been deceived into believing that just because a person said or did
something to hurt them, that person is the one they need to fight. But they're
wrong. You see, the Bible says we don't wrestle with flesh and blood. And since
people are definitely flesh and blood, they're never the source of our problem.
&quot;But, Brother Copeland, you just don't know what So-and-so did to
me!&quot; It doesn't matter. If you waste your time fighting Soand-so, your
real enemy will get away scot-free.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Who is that real enemy? Look at
Ephesians 6:12, &quot;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against
principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this
world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.&quot; Satan and his demons.
They are your lifelong enemies! They are behind every personal affront you
encounter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The people who hurt you and
persecute you are only Satan's tools. When he wants to strike out at you, he
uses them to get the job done. Remember this: Persecution is not the
manifestation of another person's hate for you. It's a manifestation of Satan's
fear of you. When you get into the Word and start swinging it around--using it
like the sword of the Spirit it is--he gets scared. So he looks for some person
he can send in there to stop you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Next time someone hurts you,
don't let yourself get sidetracked into fighting them. Bind the spirit behind
them. Put flesh and blood battles behind and war with the weapons of the
Spirit. Zero in on Satan with authority and the Word of God and bring your real
enemy down!</p>
