margin-bottom:12.25pt;margin-left:1.3pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>Matthew
16:17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Remember when you went to school
and learned your ABCs? You learned them by using your five senses and your
logical abilities to gather information and sort it out. That kind of knowledge
is called natural knowledge and it's the only kind most people know anything
about. But in the kingdom of God, there's another kind of knowing. One that
works its way from the inside out instead of from the outside in. It's called
revelation knowledge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus spoke about this kind of
knowledge in Matthew 16. He'd just asked the disciples, &quot;Who do you say I
am?&quot; Peter had answered Him by declaring, &quot;Thou art the Christ, the
Son of the living God.&quot; &quot;Blessed are you, Simon,&quot; Jesus
responded, &quot;because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My
Father which is in heaven.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In other words, Jesus was saying,
&quot;Peter, you didn't learn this information through your physical senses.
You received it another way. You received it directly from God.&quot; If you've
ever had a revelation like that, you know that when it comes, it changes
things. It makes you see old things in an entirely new light. It gives you such
unshakable confidence that, as Jesus said to Peter, &quot;The gates of hell
can't prevail against you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But revelations like that don't
come easily. You have to meditate the Word and search the Spirit of God for
them because they are &quot;hidden&quot; in Him. The Bible says God has hidden
His wisdom for the saints (1 Cor. 2:7-9). Notice, He's hidden it for you, not
from you. He wants you to have it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't think, however, that God is
just going to drop great revelations into your lap while you're watching
television. You have to seek Him. If you're hungry for revelation knowledge,
get yourself in a position to receive it by meditating the Word, praying, and
fellowshiping with the Lord. Begin to receive those revelations from Him. It's
the most exciting kind of learning there is.</p>
