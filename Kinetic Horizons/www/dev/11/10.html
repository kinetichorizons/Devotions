<h1>The Inner Witness </h1>

line-height:107%'>The Spirit itself [Himself] bears witness with our spirit.
Romans 8:16</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you ever have trouble hearing
from God? Do you find yourself caught in confusing circumstances needing
guidance, and yet even after praying and reading the Word--you're still not
sure what God wants you to do? I've had that experience. I knew His written
Word and acting on it changed my life. But I was uncertain when I had to make
decisions about things the Word didn't specifically address. Things like
whether to move to one city or another, for example. What held me back was my
ability to know that I was doing the right thing. You see, God's written Word
and the inward witness are two different things. They never contradict each
other, but they're both a vital part of our walk with God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God expected Israel, for example,
to obey His written Word. But He also said to them, &quot;Obey my voice&quot;
(Jer. 7:23) because He wanted them to know His will in specific situations.
That's what happened when Israel invaded Jericho. They heard God's voice. Where
else do you think they would have gotten that strange battle plan? It wasn't
written in the law of Moses. And certainly, no human being would suggest a
seven-day march around a city as the most effective form of invasion!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But exactly how, you may wonder,
does God speak to us? Does He just shout down at us from heaven? Not usually!
Romans 8 says the Holy Spirit bears witness with our spirit. That means that
God's directions come from inside, not outside, of you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>At times when you hear His
guidance, you may even wonder, &quot;Was that me, Lord, or was that You?&quot;
That's because God doesn't normally inject thoughts directly into your mind
from the outside. Instead, He speaks to your spirit, and your spirit translates
it into a thought. Tune in today to that inward witness, to that quiet knowing,
that urging, prompting and leading arising within you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If when you hear it, it sounds
like you, don't be surprised. It is you! It is your spirit being influenced by
the Spirit of God! After you're born again, your spirit is a safe guide because
you are born of God's Spirit. You have His nature. And the Holy Spirit lives in
your spirit to teach you and to give you direction.</p>
