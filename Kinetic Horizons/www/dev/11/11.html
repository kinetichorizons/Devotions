<h1>A Powerhouse of Protection </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

line-height:99%'>No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every
tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment you shall condemn. This is the
heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, says
the Lord. Isaiah 54:17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>No weapon formed against you
shall prosper. Isn't that great news! Isn't it good to know that no sickness,
no circumstance, no problem that rises against you can successfully bring you
down?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Some years ago, one of our
friends was facing a lawsuit. He and I prayed together according to this
scripture and agreed it was the final word in the situation, not the
allegations against him. We stood in faith, believing that lawsuit had to
fail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Sure enough, when my friend went
to court, they just couldn't beat him. He didn't win that case because of his
keen and witty lawyers. He won because he was innocent and because he had
believed that powerful promise of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Follow his example. When the
devil attacks you in some area of your life, don't sit around crying and
begging God to save you. Open up your Bible to Isaiah 54:17 instead. Remind
yourself of what God has promised you. Use that promise to strengthen you
against sin and every other evil work the devil would like to use to keep you
bound.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Then establish yourself on it
through prayer. Say, &quot;Lord, I refuse to be afraid of this weapon the devil
has brought against me because I know that according to Your Word, it cannot
prosper. I trust You to protect me, and I thank You for it now. In Jesus' Name.
Amen.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't let the powerhouse of God's
protection go to waste. Put it to work in your life. It is your rightful
heritage as a servant of the Lord.</p>
