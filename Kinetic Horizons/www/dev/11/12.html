<h1>Open the Flow </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:.05pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:99%'>Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a
cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so
easily beset us,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:12.9pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:99%'>and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith. Hebrews 12:1-2</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Disciplining the flesh. For many
believers that phrase stirs memories of frustration and failure. They know it's
important--the Word of God clearly teaches that. But they're not sure exactly
how to go about it. Some have given up, shrugging off such discipline as
impossible. Others are still fighting stubbornly to get their flesh under
control--and losing one battle after another. But it doesn't have to be that
way. In fact, we can't afford to let it be that way. It will cost us too much. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You and I are blessed to be part
of the generation that will see the signs and wonders which the prophets of old
wished they could have lived long enough to see. We will witness the Spirit of
God poured out upon all flesh. But sin hinders the Spirit's flow. And only as
we rid ourselves of it will the power and glory of God be manifested through
us. Only then will we experience the wonderful things that are prophesied to
take place in our generation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So put your past failure behind
you. Make up your mind that you're not going to let the sins of the flesh rob
you of the glory of God. It is possible to step out of the sin you've struggled
with so long and live under the Spirit's control. Look to Jesus...He will show
you how.</p>
