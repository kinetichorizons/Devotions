<h1>Put Love to Work </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:105%'>And now abides faith, hope, charity, these three; but the
greatest of these is charity. 1 Corinthians 13:13</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What do you do when you're facing
a particularly stubborn problem? A problem that resists your every effort to solve
it? Put the power of love to work on it! The power of love is the greatest
power in the universe. It's beyond defeat. It never fails (1 Cor. 13:8). The
Bible says God is love. So when you release love into a situation, you have
released God into it. Think about that! When you start releasing love into a
situation, Jesus becomes responsible for its success.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>What is this love I'm talking about? First Corinthians 13
tells us it's patient and kind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It's not jealous or haughty or
conceited or rude. It doesn't insist on its own way. It's not touchy or
resentful and it pays no attention to a suffered wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Love rejoices when right and
truth prevail and it bears up under anything and everything that comes. It's
ever ready to believe the best of every person. Its hopes are fadeless under
all circumstances and it endures everything without weakening (The Amplified
Bible). The person who refuses to love is missing out on the very best God has
to offer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't you miss out on any of it.
Release love every moment into every situation, every prayer and every thought
until it totally consumes your life. It will strengthen you and cast out every
fear that has robbed you of God's greater blessings. It will drive the devil
out of your affairs and set you free from every torment of darkness. Put love
to work on the stubborn problems in your life. It's the one solution they'll
never be able to resist.</p>
