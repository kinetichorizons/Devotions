<h1>Pick Up Your Sword </h1>

line-height:107%'>But thou, O man of God...fight the good fight of faith.1
Timothy 6:11-12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When you're up against the wall,
don't start begging God to break through it for you. That's not the way He
works. He'll give you the plan. He'll give you the power. And He'll guarantee
the victory. But your hand, not His own, is the instrument He's going to use to
get the job done. You're going to have to stretch forth your hand by speaking
and acting on the Word, even when circumstances are against you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God gave me a striking revelation
of that over 20 years ago through a vision He gave me in Beaumont, Texas. I was
preparing to minister in a service there, spending some time in prayer, when
suddenly I saw myself standing in the pulpit of the church. Looking up, I saw a
dragon--a horrible, ugly thing--poke his head through the front door of the
church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As he came into the church, his
body expanded like a balloon, filling the whole room. He was snorting fire and
smoke. When, in the vision, he turned it on me, he almost burned my clothes! As
I fell back onto the floor, I saw Jesus standing nearby with a sword in His
hand. &quot;Why doesn't He do something about this?&quot; I thought.
&quot;Can't He see I'm hurting?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But He didn't move. He just stood
by with a frown on His face. I could tell He was really put out with me. The
Bible says God was not pleased with those who were overthrown in the wilderness
(1 Cor. 10:5). And He wasn't pleased with me either as I lay there on my back
in defeat. Then Jesus held out the sword to me and pointed at the dragon. The
look on His face said, &quot;Get up!&quot; I reached up to catch hold of the
sword, and an instant before I touched it, Jesus turned it loose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The sword stayed in mid air of
its own accord. I grabbed it and began to pull myself up. Not only did it hold
firm, but it began to lift me! I stood and touched the dragon's chin with my
sword and it split him from one end to the other. It laid him open right before
my eyes. In amazement, I looked down at the sword. &quot;Why haven't I used
this before?&quot; I thought. Don't wait for God to slay the dragon in your
life. You have the sword of the Spirit, the all-powerful Word of the living
God, at your fingertips. Pick it up and use it today!</p>
