<h1>The Power to Create </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:1.4pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:103%'>Therefore be imitators of God--copy Him and follow His
example--as wellbeloved children</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.3pt;margin-left:1.4pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'>[imitate
their father]. Ephesians 5:1</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2pt;margin-bottom:11.85pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Creating new things, changing old things. Because you and I
are made in the image of God that's something we're always trying to do. But if
we're to be successful at it, we need to learn a lesson about it from the
Creator Himself, our very own heavenly Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2pt;margin-bottom:11.85pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>You know, He didn't just come upon creation by accident and
say, &quot;Well, what do you know! There's light!&quot; No, before He began to
make His universe, He first had a desired result (an inner idea, or image, of
what He wanted to create) and then said, &quot;Light be!&quot; and light was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2pt;margin-bottom:11.85pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>If we're going to imitate Him, we're going to have to put
the principle of the inner image to work too. &quot;But, Brother
Copeland,&quot; you say, &quot;that was God. Surely you don't expect me to try
to act like God.&quot; I most certainly do. Ephesians 5:1 says to! Let me warn
you about something though. Don't waste your time sitting around trying to
dream up a positive inner image all on your own. That's nothing more than
positive thinking, and while it's better than negative thinking (or not
thinking at all), it will eventually fall flat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2pt;margin-bottom:11.85pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>If you're a born-again child of Almighty God, God has given
you the principle and the power to make permanent changes in your life and in
your circumstances. Think again about creation. God wanted light. So He said,
&quot;Let there be light.&quot; The words He spoke were directly related to His
inner image. He used His Words to get that image from the inside to the
outside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.2pt;margin-bottom:10.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>What you need to use as the basis for your inner image and
for the words you speak is the Word of God. The Word has supernatural power.
And if you fill that Word with faith and speak it out, it will work for you to
change your life and circumstances as surely as it did for your Father. Find
out what real creativity is all about. Dig into the Word of God and start
rebuilding your world today. <b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>2 Corinthians 4:6-13</b>
