<h1>From Milk to Meat </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:13.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:99%'>For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need
that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God;
and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. Hebrews 5:12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Do you want to know why the Body
of Christ has been in such a mess over the past few years? Do you want to know
why the devil has been able to make a public display of our weaknesses? Do you
want to know why, instead of being unified and strong, we've often been torn
apart by division and criticisms that come not from without but within? It is
because, as the Lord said in Hebrews, the people of God have need of milk and
not of strong meat. They're babies! The people of God for the most part don't
know His ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's why He's commissioned you
and me to train believers who are unskilled in the Word of righteousness and
help bring them to maturity. &quot;Sure,&quot; you say, &quot;you're a
preacher, but what about me? What can I do?&quot; Well, I'll tell you. I believe
God has called us both to do something. You'll find it in Hebrews 3:13.
&quot;Exhort one another daily, while it is called today.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's no longer just a Bible
verse to me. It's a direct command from the Lord. Gloria and I received that
command a few years ago when we were preaching in Australia. It prompted us to
step out in faith on daily television. But it's not a command that was just
meant for us. It's one we all must obey in our own way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;Exhort one another
daily.&quot; Pray over that scripture today, won't you? Fellowship with your
Father over it. Ask Him how He wants you to fulfill that command. He may tell
you to help support ministries like Gloria's and mine who teach the
uncompromised Word of God daily. He may tell you to fill yourself so full of
His Word that it spills out on everyone you meet and encourages them to go
on-and grow on--in Jesus. Whatever He says, do it! There's a Church full of
spiritual babies out there and more are being born all the time. You can help
bring them from milk to meat. Begin to exhort them. Today.</p>
