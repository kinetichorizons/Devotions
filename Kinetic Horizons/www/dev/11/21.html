<h1>Give God the Glory </h1>

shall ye be my disciples. </i>John 15:8</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>There's an old Full Gospel
tradition that says God gets glory from the wonderful way His children bear
pain and agony and that the world is impressed by that. What a lie! That's
simply a tool of the devil to keep God's children in bondage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>People of the world already have
all the pain and agony they want. They aren't looking for a way into it. They
are looking for a way out. They don't care what you preach. It's the religious
people who get worried about that. The world, the sinners, are smarter than that.
All they care about are the results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's why they'll come to your
church when they hear people are getting healed, delivered and set <a

what they're looking for, and that's what God wants them to receive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Bible says that God gets
glory when they see the lame walk and the blind see (Matt. 15:31). Jesus said,
&quot;Herein is My Father glorified, when you bear much fruit&quot; (John
15:8). What is that fruit? Lives being restored and healed by the power of God. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>There was a man who came to one
of our healing meetings who was so far gone with cancer he had almost no energy
or life about him. He didn't even know the Lord, but he came expecting a <a
href="http://www.kcm.org/index.php?p=daily_devotional&amp;devo_choices=FTHTOFTH&amp;devo_language=ENG&amp;devo_topic=&amp;date=2012-11-21"><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>miracle.</span></a> During the miracle
service, the Lord told Ken someone was being healed of cancer, in the glands,
in the throat, and in the chest. When the man came up and received his healing,
he said, &quot;I left the hospital this morning with cancer and I'm
healed.&quot; He went back to the hospital that afternoon and the doctors
checked and dismissed him. As a result, the man received Jesus as his Lord, and
later that day he was restored to his wife from whom he'd been separated. He
got born again, healed and his marriage put back together in one day!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Now that's fruit! That brings God
glory. When we minister healing and deliverance like Jesus on the earth, that
brings God glory. Let's do away with religious tradition and go with what the
Word says. Let's impress the world with Jesus and give God the glory today!</p>
