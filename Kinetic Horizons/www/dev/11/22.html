<h1>Become Sensitive Again </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.9pt;margin-left:1.4pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:normal'>Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and
evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to
another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake
hath forgiven you. Ephesians 4:31-32</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>A few years ago I was in Detroit,
and I met a woman who was raised in a communist-bloc country. While I was
visiting with her, a news broadcast came on. And as we sat there listening to
it, suddenly tears came to her eyes. &quot;What's the matter?&quot; I asked.
Although I hadn't noticed it, the news commentator had said something
derogatory about the president. &quot;I don't like to hear anybody talk about
this country like that,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't care whether it's true or
not. I don't want to hear it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The newscaster's comment had
slipped right by me. But it had brought tears to her eyes. Why? Because she had
a sensitive heart where this country is concerned. We need to be more like that
dear lady when it comes to our pastors, our teachers, our evangelists and even
our fellow believers. We need to realize that our own insensitivity has driven
the anointing of the Holy Spirit from many of our lives and our churches. We
need to realize that the license we've given ourselves to criticize other
members of the Body of Christ has weakened us all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What will strengthen us again?
The power and the anointing of the Holy Spirit that falls on every sensitive
and seeking heart. I urge you to regain the tender heart you once had. Remove
callouses within you by repentance, by a commitment to live the law of love, by
a renewed devotion to the Word, and by fellowship with your Father. Don't allow
the condition of your heart to hold back the Spirit of God. Become sensitive
again!</p>
