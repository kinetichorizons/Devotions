<h1>Obey Him in the Little Things </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>He who is faithful in a very little [thing], is faithful
also in much. Luke 16:10</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Have you ever wanted to take on
some really big project in the kingdom of God, but the Lord just wouldn't seem
to let you? If so, there's probably a good reason why. You can see what I'm
talking about if you'll read about what God did with the children of Israel
after He brought them out of Egypt. He wanted to take them on into the Promised
Land. But before He could do it, God had to know if they would obey Him. He had
to know if they would listen to His voice. Because if they didn't, the enemies
they were about to face would wipe them out. So, do you know what He did? He
tested them in a small matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Exodus 16:4 tells us about this
simple test. &quot;Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread
from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate
every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or
not.&quot; God took a little, insignificant matter, the food they ate--and used
it to see if they would listen to Him or not. He told them how much of it to
gather, when to gather and when not to, and what to do with it after they
brought it in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>And the Israelites went right out
and violated those instructions. They showed God by their actions that His
voice was not important to them. They were not willing to obey even His
simplest commands. God works the same way today. Before He sends you on a major
mission, He gives you the opportunity to prove you can be trusted with small
instructions. But many of us miss that opportunity. We pray, &quot;What do You
want me to do, Lord? Where do You want me to go? I'll do anything You
say.&quot; But then when the Lord says, &quot;I want you to get up and pray in
the Spirit one hour every morning,&quot; we fail to obey Him. We say, &quot;Oh
yeah, that would be good. I ought to do that.&quot; But somehow we never quite
get around to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Don't make that mistake. Start today
obeying God in the little things. Let Him see that He can trust you out there
in a place of much authority. Let Him know you'll be faithful to His Words and
to the voice of His Spirit. Once He knows you won't let disobedience wipe you
out, He'll start sending bigger assignments your way.                 </p>
