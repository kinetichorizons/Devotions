<h1>Let Your Life Shine </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.25pt;
margin-bottom:11.6pt;margin-left:2.75pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><i>Be
thou an example of the believers in word, in conversation, in charity, in
spirit, in faith, in purity. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:11.6pt;margin-left:2.75pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><i> 1
Timothy 4:12 </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>One thing the world needs to see
is good examples. They need to see believers walk in love and purity and faith
in their homes, in their schools and in their businesses. The Apostle Paul
exhorts us in Romans 12:17 to live above reproach in the sight of all men.
Other scriptures teach us to avoid all appearance of evil. So, when you go
after God, don't walk out on the edge, trying to see how much you can get by
with. Go all out in God's direction. Conduct yourself in a way that will put to
rest any question about whether or not you're a Christian. Let the people
around you see your love and faith and purity in every situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Your example will go a lot
further than your words. When our son, John, was a little boy, we were spending
time with my grandparents. John was sleeping with my granddaddy and he woke him
up in the night and said, &quot;Pop, I have an earache. Would you pray for
it?&quot; Well, my grandparents were raised in a church that didn't believe in
healing. I don't know what Pop did, but it didn't work. So, John just got up
and said, &quot;I'm going to go get in bed with my mother. When she prays, it
stops hurting.&quot; About 18 years later, Pop told me the story.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You see, I had set an example of
faith and love and John remembered it. While your children are growing up, they
might forget some of the sermons you've preached or act like they're not
interested in the things of God. But they'll never forget your example. Even at
the place where you work or go to school or just in your neighborhood, people
might reject or argue with the words you say. But they'll never refute or
forget your acts of love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.05pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:146%'>Don't let petty sins and spiritual
compromises cast a shadow over your example. Live above reproach and let the
light of Jesus shine brightly through you. <b>Scripture Reading:</b> <b>Romans
12:9-21</b></p>
