line-height:99%'>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of
the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. Colossians 3:17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Did you know your name has been
changed? It's no longer the same as it was before you were born again. You gave
your old name away when you made covenant with Jesus. To fully appreciate what
that means, you have to think about it in the light of what we know about blood
covenant. When someone enters a covenant of blood, he is giving himself
completely away. He is no longer his own. His assets and his debts, his
strengths and his weaknesses belong forever to his covenant brother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When you're in blood covenant
with someone, that person's name becomes your name forever. You cannot escape
it--good or bad--it's yours. When you received Jesus as your Lord and Savior,
He took your name! Your name was sin. Your name was weakness. Your name was
fear and poverty and every other evil thing you inherited from Adam. Jesus took
those names from you and gave you His own in exchange. That's right! Ephesians
3:15 says that the whole Body of Christ has been named after Him both in heaven
and earth. That means you have been given Jesus' Name. Its authority is now
yours!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Just think about who you're named
after:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;Jesus, Mighty God, Wisdom, Deliverer, Lion of the
Tribe of Judah, Word of Life,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Advocate, Provider, The Great I Am, Helper, Savior, Prince
of Peace, Wonderful</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Counselor, Lamb of God, Lord of Hosts, Root of David,
Author and Finisher of our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Faith, The Way, Healer, Son of
God, The Truth, Chief Cornerstone, King of Kings, Light of the World, Chief
Shepherd, My Strength and Song, Righteous Judge, Son of Righteousness,
Resurrection and Life, The Alpha and Omega.&quot; Praise God, those names cover
any need you'll ever have. What's more, the power of God is in His Name to
bring that Name to pass in your life (Acts 3:16).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You can't call yourself
discouraged anymore. That's not your name. You can't answer when the devil
yells, &quot;Hey, poor boy.&quot; That's not your name. Jesus has taken those
old names of yours. They're gone. So meditate on the names of the Lord. They're
all wrapped up in the Name of Jesus, the Name above all names, and that Name
with all its power and authority has been given to you!</p>
