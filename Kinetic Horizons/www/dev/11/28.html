<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Apart from the Word of God itself

University. As co-pilot on the airplane that transported him and his staff to
his healing meetings, I had the opportunity to study Oral Roberts up close. I
followed him around. I heard him preach. I watched him lay hands on the sick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I'll never forget the day I had
the opportunity to put some of what I'd learned from him into action. I'd just
been to a few of his meetings. Spiritually, I was still as green as a gourd.
But I'd been assigned to help the people in the invalid room get ready for
Brother Roberts to lay hands on them. I was standing there for the first time
surrounded by every kind of sickness and disease you can imagine. And when
Brother Roberts came in, instead of laying hands on the people himself, he
caught me by the coat sleeve and said, &quot;You're going to do the praying.
You're going to lay hands on them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I know all the blood must have
drained out of my face because I'd never prayed for anything like that in my
life. I might have considered praying for a headache or maybe a serious
hangnail, but that's it!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The first lady we came to had
cancer of the stomach. She weighed less than 80 pounds. She was just the
picture of death. I walked over toward her and before I could open my mouth, I
heard a voice from behind me say, &quot;In the Name of Jesus, take up your bed
and walk.&quot; She instantly spit that cancer out on the floor. Then she
jumped off that bed and screamed, &quot;I'm healed,&quot; and started running
around the room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Let me tell you, that moment
changed me. When I stepped up to the next person and raised my hands, I could
see the healing coming. I'd seen Jesus heal through Brother Roberts, so in my
mind's eye, I could see Him healing through me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You can do the same thing. Find
someone who's operating in more faith and power than you are and learn from
him. Watch Jesus in them and then copy Him. Sooner or later, others will <a
