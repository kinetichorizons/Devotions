<h1>Abide in the Word </h1>

line-height:104%'>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask
what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:12.25pt;margin-left:1.3pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'>John
15:7</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That word abide is so important.
When Jesus told us to obey His commandments and keep His Word, He wasn't just
telling us to follow a bunch of religious rules and regulations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He was telling us to allow His
Word--which is a living thing!--to make its home within us. He was telling us
to spend time with it, to meditate on it, to fill our minds and our mouths with
it, and to let it guide our every action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The Apostle Paul put it this way,
&quot;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly...&quot; (Col. 3:16). Most believers
don't have any idea what that means. That's one of the reasons they're so short
on power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Oral Roberts once said that when
the Word is really abiding in you, when it's alive and producing like it
should, you can hear it. You know what it's like when you get a song on your
mind and you just keep hearing it over and over inside you? Well, when you
start abiding in the Word, you're probably going to hear it in much that same
way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Many times, I've been in
desperate situations, wondering what I was going to do when suddenly I'd hear a
scripture down on the inside of me. Suddenly, I'd know exactly what the answer
to my situation was. I'd be delivered by the Word of God that was dwelling in
me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>So, invite the Holy Spirit to go
to work on your behalf. Just keep telling Him, &quot;Whatever You bring to my
remembrance from the Word is exactly what I'm going to act on. I'm going to be
obedient to every command of Jesus that You bring to mind.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Make a quality decision to abide
in the Word. You'll soon discover that the Word is abiding in you.</p>
