<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It always amazes me when I preach
about prosperity and someone comes up to me and says, &quot;I don't need much
prosperity. I'm a simple person with a simple life. So I just ask God for
enough to meet my needs.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>They think that's humility, but
it's not. It's selfishness! They don't realize it, but they're actually saying,
&quot;All I care about is meeting my own needs. I have no ambition to help meet
anyone else's.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>They could ask God for a million
dollars, take out just enough to meet their needs, and give the rest away. But
that doesn't even occur to them because when it comes to money, they've been
brainwashed by a world that says if you have it, you've got to keep it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That philosophy has hindered the
ministry of Jesus Christ on the earth today. It has caused preachers to set
aside their calling and get secular jobs just to survive. It's handicapped
churches and stunted the growth of ministries that could have reached thousands
more for the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>It takes money to preach the
gospel. Jesus Himself knew that, and contrary to what some people think, His
ministry was not a poor one. He had so much money coming in and going out
through His ministry that He had to appoint a treasurer. His name was Judas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But Jesus didn't store up that<a

meet the needs of those around Him. He had such a reputation for giving that on
the night of that last Passover when Judas left so abruptly, the disciples
assumed that Jesus had sent him out to give to the poor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Can you imagine how much and how
often Jesus must have given to the poor for the disciples to make that
assumption?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Jesus never built a worldly empire
for Himself. But that doesn't mean He was poor. It means He was the greatest
giver who ever walked the face of this earth, and it's time we started
following in His footsteps.</p>
