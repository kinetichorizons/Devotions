<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Fear of failure. It's haunted all
of us at some time in our lives. Popular psychology tells us to adjust to it.
But the Word of God tells us that there is a failure-proof way to live without
it. It is the way of LOVE.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you want to know real success,
you must learn to be moved and motivated by love. That's how Jesus was when He
was on the earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Even when John the Baptist was
senselessly, brutally murdered and Jesus went away to be alone, He didn't
deviate from the way of love. For Matthew 14:6-14 says that even then in that
emotionally taxing time when the people followed Him and would give Him no
solitude, He was moved with compassion and healed their sick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I used to wonder how Jesus could
just turn away from that terrible crime and not retaliate. What I didn't
realize was that He did retaliate. He overcame the works of Satan with
compassion. He defeated hatred with love. He attacked Satan in the spirit realm
by destroying his works of sickness and disease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Compassion doesn't strike at the
surface of things. It goes to the root of the problem. That's why it always
succeeds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;But wait!&quot; you may
say. &quot;I can't operate like that. I'm not Jesus.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Yes you can, because the Word of
God says that His love has been shed abroad in your heart! (Rom. 5:5). And 1
John 2:5 says His love is perfected in you as you keep His Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Commit to living the life of love
today. Watch God turn failure into success at home, at work...in any situation.
LOVE NEVER FAILS!</p>
