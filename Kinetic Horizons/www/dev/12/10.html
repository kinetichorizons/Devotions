<h1>Seek God First </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:10.1pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:99%'><i>Seek ye first the kingdom
of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. </i></p>

margin-bottom:9.6pt;margin-left:1.45pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'>Matthew 6:33</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Whenever Ken and I talk about
living by faith, I know there are some people who think, &quot;Oh, that's easy
for you. You're preachers. You have it made!&quot; And, in some ways, we do. We
have it made because our calling demands that we give God our attention, and giving
God your attention always brings success.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>But we haven't always lived that
way. In fact, the first time I ever saw Kenneth Copeland he was about as far
from a preacher as I figured you could get. He flew planes and sang in
nightclubs. As for me, I was a college girl who said she would never marry a
preacher and who had never even heard about the new birth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Right after we got married, Ken
went into a business enterprise that we thought was going to make us rich. So I
quit my job and went to work for this new company. Two weeks later it folded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We ended up sleeping on a rented
roll-away bed that sagged in the middle. We had a wrought-iron coffee table Ken
made in high school and a black and white TV. Nothing else. No refrigerator. No
stove. I cooked in my coffee pot and an electric skillet and used a cardboard
box on the porch to keep our food cold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>We were flat broke. Unemployed.
Deeply in <a

style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>debt.</span></a> I had nowhere to go.
No furniture. No nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Then one day I picked up the
Bible Ken's mother had given him for his birthday. In the front she'd written
this verse, &quot;Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and
all these things shall be added unto you.&quot; I turned and read Matthew 6. It
said God cared for the birds. For the first time in my life it got into my
heart that God cared where I was and what I was doing. I figured if He cared
for birds, He cared for me! I knelt in that bare room and told Jesus that if He
could do anything with my life, He could certainly have it. That's all I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>remember saying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I had no idea I'd just been born
again. Two weeks later Ken found a <a

style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>new job.</span></a> We moved to a new
furnished apartment and bought a better car. In the midst of it all, something
else happened--Ken got born again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't worry if you don't
&quot;have it made.&quot; We certainly didn't when all this started. Just stick
with God and let Him make you. He is a good God who is good to all (Ps.
145:9).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Make a decision in your heart to
seek HIM first. Then all the other things will be added.</p>
