feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in his commandments. He </i></p>

margin-bottom:9.85pt;margin-left:3.3pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%'><i>Psalm
112:1,7 </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Are you ready to face a crisis?
Don't wait until one hits to find out. Prepare yourself now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's what a couple of my
Partners did. They faced a situation that would have made many people panic.
But when the crisis hit, their hearts were so deeply established on the Word of
God that their first response was not one of fear but of faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What affected me most when I
heard their testimony was one particular phrase they kept using:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>No Deposit--No Return</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What they meant by that was that
if you don't take the time to deposit the Word in your heart now, it won't be
there later when you really need it. You'll end up in a crisis with only doubt
and unbelief instead of the faith and power you need to see you through. In a
situation like the one this couple faced that could be deadly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You see, their two-year-old son
had suffered a fall that had cracked his skull and critically injured his neck.
He had no feeling in his arms and legs and was unable to move. Yet as they
rushed him to the emergency room, a great sense of peace rested on them. Rather
than crying with fear, they prayed in faith and declared, &quot;By Jesus'
stripes, our son is healed!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Sure enough, within hours, their
boy was totally restored. Even the X-rays verified the fact that a miracle had
taken place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What's important to understand
about that story is this: The victory was not won when the damage to that
little boy's body disappeared. It was won all during the days and weeks and
months before when his parents were listening to tapes and studying the Word
and praying in the Spirit. It was won because these people had spent time
building a foundation on the Word so that when this storm came, they were able
to stand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Now is the time for you to build
a rock-solid foundation! Don't wait around until you're faced with a crisis.
Get the Word in your heart in abundance now, so when you really need it, it
will flow out in power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Remember: No deposit--no return.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Start making those precious
deposits today!</p>
