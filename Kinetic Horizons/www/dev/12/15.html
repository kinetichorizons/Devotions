<h1>A Carefree Christmas </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-bottom:.1pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:143%'><i><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:143%'>Be careful
for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving
let your requests be made known unto God.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.1pt;
margin-bottom:10.4pt;margin-left:.5pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%'><i><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:107%'>Philippians 4:6</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Can you really have a merry
Christmas even when you have a thousand and one pressures bearing down on you?
Yes, you can--and you don't have to leave the country to do it. No matter how
intense or how trivial the problems are that you're facing right now, you can
have the most wonderful, most carefree Christmas season you've ever had in your
life; and you can start having it today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As a believer, you're probably
familiar with that scripture that says to be anxious for nothing. But, have you
ever taken it seriously enough to put it into action? There's a good chance you
haven't because you haven't understood just how dangerous those anxieties are.
You probably haven't realized that they're a deadly part of the devil's
strategy against you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's right. Worry is one of the
chief weapons of his warfare. If he can get you to worry about them, he can use
the financial pressures and family pressures and scheduling problems that are
just a &quot;normal&quot; part of everyday life to weigh you down and drag you
into more trouble than you think possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Medical science tells us that a
high percentage of the people hospitalized in the U.S.A. are there with
ailments caused by worry and tension. Yet, a great many believers worry without
even thinking about it. They'll worry about being too short or too skinny.
They'll stew over this and that and not even realize they've been sinning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;Sinning, Brother
Copeland?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Yes! For the born-again,
Spirit-filled believer who owns a Bible--worrying is a sin. So, even if the
Christmas cards are late and 45 people are coming to your house for Christmas
dinner, don't worry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Instead, do what the Bible says
to do. Pray, making your request known to God...and praise Him for the answer.
Then you'll have peace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Now, go ahead and have a truly
merry Christmas, you carefree thing you!</p>
