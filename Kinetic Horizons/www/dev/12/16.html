<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Preparation. When it comes to
fighting spiritual battles, that's a word you'd do well to remember. Most
believers don't pay much attention to it. They don't prepare themselves in
advance. They fiddle around until the devil makes his move, then they jump up
and try to fight him with the Word... and they usually lose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I used to do the same thing until
the Lord taught me differently. I used to wait until my meetings began to pray
for their success. As Satan would come against them from one direction, I'd
fight him there. Then he'd move around and attack them in another area, and I'd
fight him there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>One day the Lord showed me that
by waiting until the last minute to take my stand, I was giving Satan time to
build up his forces against me. And consequently, I was losing many of my
battles. Then the Lord said something to me I'll never forget. He said,
&quot;&quot;If they had kicked Al Capone out of Chicago when he was just a
small-time operator, he wouldn't have been so hard to handle; but they waited
until he became a first-class criminal with his forces built up around him.
Then it took an army to bring him down.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When I heard that, I made up my
mind never to be caught unprepared again. I started praying about those
meetings weeks in advance, getting the stage set spiritually before they ever
began. Instead of letting Satan get his forces entrenched, I started throwing
him out before he got a single foothold. When I did, I saw more victories than
I ever had before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't let the devil catch you off
guard. Be prepared! Start praying and speaking the Word of faith now over your
family, your business, your church. Get your feet shod with the preparation of
the gospel of peace. Then if Satan causes trouble, you'll be well equipped to
run him out of town.</p>
