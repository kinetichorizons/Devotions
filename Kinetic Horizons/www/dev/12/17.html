toward man appeared...Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
Saviour; That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:10.05pt;margin-left:1.85pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:103%'><i>Titus
3:4,6-7 </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>A covenant of grace. That's what
you and I have with Almighty God. If you could truly grasp the significance of
that, you'd never be the same again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>What exactly is a covenant of
grace? It's a relationship of favor that gives you access to someone else's
power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>An illustration of a covenant of
grace is the covenant the old Sicilian &quot;family&quot; members have with the
&quot;godfather&quot; of the &quot;family.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In that group, a weak person
might come in and ask the Don for a favor. The Don would say, &quot;I will
grant this favor and I will ask a favor of you, and when that time comes, I
will collect it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Once that was said, the weak
person would become excited. Suddenly he knew he would no longer have this
problem because anyone who tried to rough him up would now have to face the
godfather, the one with all the power. Suddenly, that little guy's attitude
would change. He would leave the presence of the head of the family in the full
assurance that he didn't have a thing to worry about. He was no longer small
and powerless in his own mind. He had gained favor (grace) with the powerful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He'd walk out thinking,
&quot;Everything is handled. All I have to do now is whatever the Don asks me
to do--and the Don knows I don't have anything, so whatever he asks me to do,
he'll provide the wherewithal to do it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>That's grace. God's willingness
to enter into blood covenant with you and give you everything He has in
exchange for everything you have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>He took your sin to give you His
righteousness. He took your sickness to give you His health. He took your
poverty in order to meet all your needs according to His riches in glory.
Whenever He asks you to do something, He provides everything you need to carry
it out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The great Jehovah, God of heaven
and earth, is your Father God. Can you understand that? If you're under the
blood of Jesus, you've been made a covenant child of the most powerful being in
the universe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Dare to take your place in the
family!</p>
