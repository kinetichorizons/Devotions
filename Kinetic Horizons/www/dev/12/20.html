<h1>A Little Bit of Heaven on Earth </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:1.75pt;margin-bottom:
11.6pt;margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:99%'><i><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:99%'>Put on therefore, as the elect of God,
holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
longsuffering; Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another...even as
Christ forgave you. Colossians 3:12-13</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Living in a home filled with the
love and the peace of God Himself is almost like living in heaven right here on
earth. We all know that's true. And we long to live in such a home. Yet, time
and time again, we shortchange our families. We spend our kindest words and our
most winning smiles on those beyond our front door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Have you ever wondered why?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The answer is simpler than you
might suspect. Spiritually speaking, your family is under attack. You see, it
is not only one of your most precious gifts, when it's operating in harmony,
it's one of your most powerful resources. Satan knows that even if you
don't-and he's out to destroy it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>His battle plan is simple. He
will do everything he can to create strife in your home. He'll stir up feelings
of self-pity and jealousy. He'll encourage you to nurse resentments and harbor
bitterness. And through it all, his purpose remains the same, to divide and
destroy your home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When God's people get in harmony
with each other, miracles start to happen. Their agreement creates an
atmosphere in which God's supernatural, miracle-working power is free to flow!
So Satan is constantly tempting us to spoil that atmosphere, to foul things up
by being at odds with each other. All too often we fall prey to his tactics
simply because we don't realize just how dangerous strife really is. One close
look at the Word of God will solve that problem, however. James 3:16 says,
&quot;Where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil
work.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't open the door of your home
to Satan by allowing your family the &quot;luxury&quot; of a few quarrels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Stop the destruction before it
starts. Anchor yourself to God's Word. Find out what He has to say about the
power of agreement. Stop looking at your family from your own limited
perspective and start seeing it as God sees it--as a powerhouse! That way you
won't drift helplessly into an argument every time a gust of emotion blows
through your home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Determine right now not to let
the devil have your family. Instead, pray for them, support them and love them.
Bring them together, so you can all enjoy a little bit of heaven on earth.</p>
