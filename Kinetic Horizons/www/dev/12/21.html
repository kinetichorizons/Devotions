<h1>Stick to Your Calling </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.35pt;

style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:143%'>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance
that thou stir up the gift of God.... Who hath saved us, and called us with an
holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:7.15pt;
margin-bottom:5.35pt;margin-left:11.6pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:143%'><i><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:143%'>own purpose and grace, which was
given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. 2 Timothy 1:6,9</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Are you doing what God called you
to do?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you haven't ever thought about
it before, that may sound like an odd question to you. You may be tempted to
shrug it off and say, &quot;Oh, I'm not really called to do anything. I'm not a
pastor or a teacher or a minister of any kind...I guess I'm just what you might
call a little finger on the Body of Christ.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Let me tell you something: No
matter who you are, God has put a holy calling in you. He's designed you and
called you to meet a need in the Body of Christ that nobody else can meet quite
like you can.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You may be called to be so
successful in business you can finance the gospel worldwide. You may be called
to a ministry of prayer and intercession. You may be called to a ministry of
healing right there in your own neighborhood. But no matter what that calling
is, it's important and you need to follow it!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you're like many believers I
know, you may have let your life become so overgrown with other things that you
just don't have time to pursue your calling. You may be so overwhelmed with the
cares of life that you can't imagine how you can fit in anything else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Over the years, a pastor friend
of mine got involved in so many different areas of ministry that he was about
to fold up physically under the strain of it. The overload was actually about
to kill him. Finally, the Lord spoke to him one night and said, &quot;John,
it's not your calling that's nearly killed you. It's everything else you've
added to it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I've had to deal with that in my
own life. I've had to quit doing things just because they need doing. I've had
to discipline myself to sticking to what I'm called to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Make up your mind to prayerfully
trim away the extra things you've added to your life. Stir up the gift God has
placed inside you. Get back to what He has called you to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>After all, that calling is vital.
It's holy...and it's yours. Don't ever let it slip away from you.</p>
