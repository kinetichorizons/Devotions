<h1>Go When You're Ready </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:47.8pt;

line-height:143%'><i><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:143%'>With long
life will I satisfy [you], and shew [you] my salvation. Psalm 91:16</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Did you know that it's not God's
will for you or anyone to die young? His will for you is to live the full
number of your days. You ought to live 70 or 80 years, and if you are not
satisfied, live a while longer! The Bible says that when Abraham died, he died
at a good old age, full of years. That's the way it ought to be with all of us.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Some believers don't realize that
and they've gotten themselves in a mess. When they get sick instead of just
believing for healing, they start wondering if it's God's will for them to die.
&quot;Maybe He's ready to call me home,&quot; they think.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Don't ever entertain thoughts
like that. If God has His way, He won't call you home until you're good and
ready to come. The Apostle Paul understood that. In 2 Timothy 4:6-7, he said,
&quot;For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at
hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the
faith.&quot; Paul didn't die until he and Jesus were ready for him to go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Regardless of your age, if the
devil is telling you God isn't going to heal you because it's time for you to
go home, he is lying to you. God promises in Psalm 91:16 that if you are living
under the shadow of the most High, He will satisfy you with long life. (That
means that you are abiding in Him as Jesus taught in John 15.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If you're not satisfied that you
have finished your course yet on this earth, it's not time for you to die. So
ignore the devil and keep right on living. Resist sickness and disease in the
Name of Jesus. Stand on God's promise!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Then, when you're ready to go on
to heaven, go! But go satisfied, healed, and ready! Go in victory shouting the
words of that old joy-filled song--&quot;Heaven is near and I can't stay here.
Good-bye world, good-bye.&quot;</p>
