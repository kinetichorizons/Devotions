<h1>Know Him as Daddy </h1>

Spirit which] you have now received [is] not a spirit of slavery to put you
once more in bondage to fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption--the
Spirit producing sonship--in [the bliss of] which we cry, Abba! [That is,]
Father! Romans 8:15</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>One night after a worship service
a friend of mine and I stepped outside and were suddenly awed by the beauty
around us. It was one of those crisp, clear winter nights when the brilliance
of the moon and stars nearly takes your breath away. I said to my friend,
&quot;Tommy, will you look at that!&quot; Then he looked up with one of those
Holy Ghost whole face smiles and with a voice full of tenderness said, &quot;My
Daddy made that!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&quot;My Daddy....&quot; I'll
never forget the way he said that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Some people might think he
shouldn't have been talking in such familiar terms about God, but they'd be
wrong. It's scriptural to talk that way about Him. In the New Testament there's
a Greek word for father-- Abba. The most accurate translation for that word in
English is Daddy. It's a word that signifies closeness. It speaks of a
relationship that's been developed through time spent together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Father is one thing. Daddy is
another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Growing up, my father was
sometimes my Father and sometimes my Daddy. When we were out duck hunting, he
was Daddy. When he gave commands he meant to be obeyed instantly, he was
Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>God is like that too. He's your
Father and He's your Daddy. There are times you'll be very serious and down to
business with one another. Other times you'll be more lighthearted. But either
way, once you fellowship with Him enough to get to know Him, I guarantee,
you'll want to be close to Him all the time.</p>
