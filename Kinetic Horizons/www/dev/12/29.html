<h1>Remember Noah </h1>

style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:143%'>And the Lord said, I will destroy man
whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the
creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made
them. But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:10.4pt;margin-left:3.25pt;text-align:center;font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%'><i><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:107%'>Genesis 6:7-8</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>One of the dirtiest, most
damaging lies that the devil ever told you was when he said, &quot;You aren't
important.&quot; Don't you ever believe that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>You are important! Every born-again
member in the Church of Jesus Christ has a part to play in God's plan. God has
something for you to do that no one else can do just like you can. If you don't
take your place and do your part, things won't be quite right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>I can just hear you thinking,
&quot;Oh, Gloria, I'm just one person. What could I possibly do that could be
so significant?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Look in Genesis 6, and you'll see
the answer to that question. There you'll see that the people on the earth had
gotten so wicked that God had regretted that He'd made them. He was ready to
wipe the whole population out--but He didn't. Why? Because of one man: Noah!
One obedient man saved the human race.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Think about that. What if Noah
had said, &quot;Well, this is just too much pressure for me. I can't live
upright before God in the middle of this ungodly generation. I mean, everybody
around me is living the other way. Every man around me imagines only evil in
his heart. I can't make any difference in this dark world anyway. I'm just one
man.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Praise God, Noah didn't say that.
He didn't picture himself as an insignificant man whose life didn't matter.
According to Hebrews, he saw himself as a man to whom God had spoken and by
faith he obeyed God. And because of that he ended up being the only thing that
stood between mankind and total destruction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Next time you're tempted to shrug
off the instructions of God and be disobedient, next time you catch yourself
thinking, &quot;It doesn't matter what I do&quot;--remember Noah. Consider the
fact that, whether you understand it or not, God is counting on you to carry
out your part of His plan. Live like you're someone important in the kingdom of
God. And sooner or later you'll realize, you are.</p>
